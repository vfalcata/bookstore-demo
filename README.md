To circumvent any security risks with previous commits, this project is uploaded as a single commit. As this is only a demo project and not a production application this is sufficient.

This is a Bookstore application built in a monolithic architecture with Java and SQL, as well as JSP and JSPX technologies, it also has in hand buit object relational mapper. As this is a single commit the log of each individual's contribution has been removed. I worked on the code generators, seleniuim scripts for data scraping as well as anything that has to do with the data layer. Much of the personal information and documents were omitted. The full project log is available upon request and would require permisson from all parties involved.
