That was a lot of drama packed into 912 pages That said, I really enjoyed the end of Emma and Julien''s journey. They definitely had a lot of challenges in this story. From the beginning where Julian makes a choice that I was surprised by and definitely took the story to some interesting places. The same can be said with Ty, who I do find to be a complicated character and whose choice led to some heart-rending moments. The action and pacing were great, and it was excellent to see new and old characters overcome obstacles and come to terms with their emotions. The romances were an obvious draw and totally swoon-worthy. I enjoyed a lot of them, including side romances like Gwyn and Diana, but my favourites were Kit and Ty, and Christina, Mark. Kieran. But for me, the best parts were the world building and a section in part two that I won''t spoil, but takes the reader to a completely unexpected place that I can''t say I would want to be, but definitely found interesting, if horrifying. It breathed new life into a series that, while beloved, has become familiar in some aspects. I also loved all the massive changes that took place in the ShadowhunterDownworlder society, especially near the end when everything was wrapping up. It will certainly lead into another book, which leads me to my one teeny tiny gripe The epilogue. It came out of nowhere, might compel me to read the last Shadowhunter trilogy which I didn''t plan on, and nearly made me shout Just leave them alone Still... it would be interesting to see where it goes. But that''s more of a fangirl complaint than a story complaint. I did find QoAaD to be fast-paced, emotional, intense, and rich in its lore and thrills. Fans of this world will be satisfied with this particular finale, and even though I wish some characters would just be able to get their happy endings, I would be lying if I said I didn''t want to see more of them.',1626652800000),

The easiest way to describe this is expect the Crows to be equivalent to Dragons in most stories. Plot There are politics, different countries at war of course, and strong relationships. Not only are there some partners meeting up, but also lovely friendships and even some sisterhood moments. This places Kalyn Josephson in a category above most of the average YA writers of today as she was able to create love in more than just the average pairing. Depression I would be surprised to learn if Josephson hasnt had some mental health moments in her life. The descriptions and emotions of our lead gal who is suffering from depression are very well done. And instead of having the depression last a day and magically getting it better The Storm Crow focuses on finding our lead gal purpose and inspiring her to have desires. Overall Im really impressed with Josephsons first book. If she continues to improve on what she has begun in The Storm Crow Im confident she will be the next big teen fantasy author. Her pacing, descriptions, world building and characters are all at a quality above the average author in this genre. The more I think about this book the more I feel my four stars might be too low. So consider this one a solid 4 stars with an opportunity to jump to 5 if the sequel carries forward on par or stronger. I just need to keep remembering that a giant Crow is as cool and sleek as a Dragon. ? Please note I received an eARC of this book from the publisher via NetGalley. This is an honest and unbiased review.',1626652800000),

Any spoilers have warnings beforehand This book is hard to judge because there are parts of it that are phenomenal, and other parts that just ruined it, but lets start by covering whats great For someone looking for a story like the thrilling dystopia that was the hunger games, this book is not the book for you. This book seems like it leans more towards people who want to think and ponder ideas about human nature. That being said, it does that well. Its interesting in a very different way because it features a capitol before everyone revelled in watching teenagers murder each other for sport. It allows you to see the way people can slowly be manipulated and the way that building society off of an incorrect idea about human nature can result in a society as twisted as we see in the hunger games. I am highly impressed at the way the book comments on the impact our worldview has on everything, and subsequently, how important it is to have the right one. That being said, there are a lot of other things the book didnt do so well There wasnt really a plot driving the story. While it was generally about Snow trying to climb his way to a life of success, even that never felt like a solid plot point. Spoiler ahead dont read until next paragraph It seems like the book was divided in two between the unified games section of the book and then the random, confusing, secondary part of his time as a peacekeeper in district 12. Once the games ended it seemed like the book just didnt know where it was going -which is probably a sign that there was not enough plot in the first place. We were just following Snow around, but were as lost as he was as to whether there was any actual point to it all. Another issue is that even though this is a book seemingly all about how Snow went from this poor boy looking for his shot in life to the villain of the hunger games, his character never quite seemed consistent. There were decisions he made and thoughts he had that didnt feel authentic. Even his nihilistic and negative perspectives felt forced at times. While the book commented on world views, the main character seemed to flop around with his own a lot and change his mind even more. Last but certainly not least, the ending was not good. I shouldnt be surprised that a book with little plot fails to actually conclude, but this ending was something else. Im not normally one to say something like this, but the ending literally came out of nowhere. Spoilers ahead, dont read until next paragraph one moment hes running away with Lucy, which didnt seem at all like his character to even contemplate, then hes chasing her down in the forest trying to kill her? Like the end went from 0 to 100 so quick and felt so disjointed from the rest of the story that it just felt like Collins ran out of time writing it and just tried to close it up as quickly as possible. Then the epilogue felt like endless plot convenience. Everything was suddenly handed to Snow and it didnt feel like most any of it was realistic. Once again destroying all that work the author put in to crafting a story about Snows rise to the top. Instead this book felt like Snows gradual fall to the bottom and overly convenient epilogue where all his problems are suddenly solved and wrapped up in a nice bow with no consequences. Its not that this book was bad per se, but there are some glaring issues that keep it from being good. I wanted to love it in spite of the many negative reviews but instead it ended up being an okay version of the book it could have been with more careful planning.',1637625600000),

Having successfully freed the Marigold from Saint, Fable and its crew had big plans for their autonomy. Unfortunately, others have different ideas of their own for her. Though there''s a familiar face aboard Zola''s ship, it seems clear she''s been betrayed. Caught in the middle of multiple schemes, she''s the common denominator in all of them. In order to get home and save those who mean the most to her, Fable must agree to work with Holland.. a vicious woman who runs the Unnamed Sea''s gem trade. If you loved the first book, the second is even better. The story hits the ground running, as things are already out of hand and Fable isn''t sure what her future holds. She''s surrounded by people she doesn''t trust, many of whom look at her like they''d rather kill her than co-exist beside her. I liked that as the story opened, as a reader.. I felt off-balance myself. There''s an adjustment period that we get to experience along with Fable as she''s trying to get her bearings and read her situation. She knows she''s in trouble, what remains to be seen is how much.. and what the results of that are going to be. She''s still a fighter though and she doesn''t whine or complain about what''s happening. Rather, she spends her time trying to observe as much as possible and plot a way out.. be that through escape or leverage. Honestly, she''s exactly the kind of female protagonist that I don''t think we get enough of. Sure, she makes mistakes and gets herself in deeper sometimes, but she never stops trying. Every time life throws her a complication, she grits her teeth and gets to problem solving. There''s no assumption that she''s defeated, no polite resignation. She strategizes and tries again. The story builds continuously throughout, as the circumstances spin further and further out of control. Eventually, there''s so much potential for things to go wrong, that you just know something is going to and you find yourself trying to decide what you could let go of if given the choice, while hoping to keep it all. As for the cast of characters, we do get to see more of her father. He''s so closed up in the first book that I was really curious about him. West is still amazing, as is Auster.. and though I still feel like all of these characters could benefit from a lot more detail, it was wonderful to finally get the AusterPaj origin story. Now I''m just sad that it was only a duology.. because I desperately want a book three or a bunch of side novels for the supporting cast. Something, anything I just need more Anyway, plenty of action and drama.. lots of familial intrigue.. and some suspense. ''Namesake'' is a choppy ride on an angry sea and I loved every minute of it.

There was plenty of drama and lore and betrayal. SO MUCH BETRAYAL. While the book started out a little slower, by the ending it moved at a great clip and had me turning page and page to see what happened next. I will confess that while I definitely need some questions answered, I also loved it. The plot points that unfolded and the treachery, while it drove me crazy at some points, were stellar. Most of them I didn''t see coming, and even if I did, I had no idea how it would play out. Jude will have many opposing enemies in the next book Hopefully there will be more of the Undersea kingdom, since I loved the brief visit there and would love to see more of it. Speaking of Jude, while I still think she made more horrible choices than sensible ones, I did find her interesting in that she was completely power-hungry. She may not be my favourite person, but I can no longer deny she is a compelling character. All those who were swept up in her path were forced to react to her choices, which added to the drama and danger. Additionally, I finally understand why so many people love Cardan. Again, he may not be my favourite character still a jerk, but he had a few moments where his true heart truly shone. I deeply look forward to seeing where he goes next. There were so many great twists near the end and a fantastic action scene in the middle. All of it complimented by Holly Black''s truly gorgeous writing style.

Not only was it fun to re-enter a world rich with lore and unique magic, but it was exciting to meet new characters from both the GRISHA trilogy and SIX OF CROWS. The story followed various different characters, but ultimately took two paths One that followed Nikolai and his inner demon, and one that followed heartbroken Nina as she went on a mission for Nikolai. Both storylines didn''t quite connect in a way that can be seen yet, but if you asked me to pick between them, I would say... why would you ask an impossible question? With Bardugo''s signature, flowing writing, the emotional scenes and heart-pounding action left an even greater impact. There were so many twists and turns, and a final line that put a chill in my bones, that the very smart characters were left scrambling as their worlds were turned upside down. Speaking of characters, I definitely can''t choose one. Nikolai is always fun, but a much deeper and more complicated character than his swaggering personality lets on. Zoya was always a hesitant fan favourite for me, but het dialogue with Nikolai, her ferocity, and her intense backstory left me cheering for her in the end. And Nina... Nina just breaks my heart all the time. Seriously, there were some tears during one particular scene, and I can''t wait to see what she gets up to next. KING OF SCARS has been hyped for a while, and it lives up to that hype and then some. A beautiful book from cover to cover, this is a book every Grishaverse fan will love, and readers of thrilling dark fantasy will crave more of.

We were introduced to the outstanding Agrippa, who is just wickedly delightful, although I think he has terrible taste in women. I can hardly wait to get more of him in Gilded Serpent, especially as I was reading and I realized how much I liked him then thinking why wasn''t he in Darker Shores? Which gets explained so don''t you worry. There were many characters I didn''t like, most of them I felt I was supposed to be against so felt it was all very fitting.

From a technical aspect, this book is very well-written with a comfortably clever dialogue as is common across the franchise. Telegraphing is minimal, action is frequent and clearly described even in more challenging settings, and storytelling is fluid. It doesn''t matter how far we run, or in what direction, Master Cohmac replied. In the end, we always come back to the beginning. ''Star Wars The High Republic Into the Dark'' by Claudia Gray is the lastest release in the brand new era of stories which lays out the path of the Jedi prior to The Phantom Menace. Gray is one of a select handful of Star Wars universe authors chosen for this set of books. Already known for other stories within the franchise history such as ''Leia Princess of Alderaan,'' ''Lost Stars,'' and ''Bloodline,'' she''s also released her own series.. the Firebird novels. Charles Soule authored the first of The High Republic era novels.. ''Light of the Jedi,'' which was released in January and ''The Rising Storm'' by Cavan Scott is due to arrive in June. How can we split the Force in two? How can we justify such an act of violence--and it is violence, such a dividing, even the darkness divided from the light. ''Into the Dark'' follows a padawan named Reath Silas who prefers the scholarly side of the Jedi Order. Most of his days at the Jedi Temple in Coruscant spent in the Archives studying, his Master takes an assignment in the undeveloped frontier in hopes it will broaden his interest in adventuring and help him achieve the much needed balance that''s central to their practice. When the ship he''s traveling on are forced to drop out of hyperspace due to a galactic-wide disaster, it''s only the first in many things that begins to upend their plans. As the Jedi and their traveling companions have to take refuge on what appears to be an abandoned space station, the Jedi themselves begin to feel something at work within the Force that unnerves them. They suffer strange visions and feelings they can''t explain. Let me never forget, he thought, that it is another living creature standing opposite my blade. Whether you''re a Star Wars fan like myself or you just enjoy great sci-fi storytelling, there''s nothing not to love about this book. It''s filled with all the angst, mystery, and betrayal that the franchise has come to be known for throughout the years and the story itself is crafted expertly. There were things I expected to occur that never did and things I never saw coming until they were upon me. I express enough how rare those kinds of occurences are for me in any kind of media consumption.. but here we are. The dynamics between the characters are wonderfully fleshed out, especially within the smaller groups that have more familiarity with one another. The natural instincts to fall back on those they often knew best.. before the others.. sometimes worked against them and I feel the story constantly pushed each of them to see beyond their biases. If you use your defeat to learn the path to victory, it was no defeat at all. Of course, it wouldn''t be a Star Wars story if it didn''t make me well up with tears at least once.. and that certainly held true here. Gray did such a great job of weaving a connection between the characters and myself as a reader.. that I felt no indifference for anyone involved.. I was either deeply invested in their survival or their end. What I often love about this franchise is that even the ''heroes'' are not infallible. They often suffer grave setbacks, question even the most desperate choices they''re forced to make, and mourn the actions they eventually succumb to taking. It doesn''t hurt, that Star Wars has taught me not to take even their most popular characters for granted.. because anyone can be lost, one way or another.. just as anyone can persevere, even if maybe we wish they wouldn''t. I received this title as an ARC. All opinions are mine and freely given.',1648339200000),

I just I don''t even know where to start, other than saying that this is not only one of the best books I''ve read all year, or my entire life. It''s one of the best books ever written. It pulled out every emotion in the end and left me in tatters, but not without hope. Not without saying, This is writing at its best. Sarah J. Maas is a master of her craft. A gifted writer who continues to draw readers through epic adventures, heart-stopping love and loyalty, and soul-crushing sacrifice. I love the THRONE OF GLASS books, but this one... this one owns my soul. Every beautiful word, every tiny scene captured me, transported me to another realm, and has made me want to be a better writer. I don''t know how she did it, but I couldn''t be more grateful to have experienced this book. Now, why does it own my life? Well, there''s the story. Utterly incredible, detailed and complex, with so many twists and turns that I could scarcely keep track of them all. The best part about it was that everything even events from THE ASSASSIN''S BLADE, which should be read to get the full weight of this book came into play. The journey that Aelin and her court made was thrilling from the moment it began to the heartbreaking finale. Characters found each other in extreme circumstances and grew in ways I never imagined. The book didn''t feel as long as it was, and it kills me to know I have another year to wait for the finale. There were scenarios that left my eyes wide with panic, my heart pounding and desperate to get to the next page, and I had to bite my tongue reading in public to stop from cheering on the characters. Aelin... I don''t know how she does it. That woman is a genius, an inspiration, and unquestionably a queen worth fighting for. Side characters like Eldie, Manon, and Lorcan surprised me. Dorian is going to have an incredible journey and I can''t wait to see what happens to him. Aeidon and Lysandra were amazing and had great inspirations. And Rowan... Oh gods, there are no words for Rowan. Maas certainly knows how to make you fall in love with characters like him. There''s a reason her romances threaten to stop my heart whenever I read them. The ending... I can barely talk about the ending. It was brutal and I cringe about the opening of book six, but it was also beautiful. The sacrifice and pain that was endured, what it all forged toward, the gravity of it... You''re not human if you don''t feel something during those last 100 pages. This is the longest review I''ve ever written outside of my website, because this has easily become my favourite book of all time. EMPIRE OF STORMS is one of the many books that has now shown me what epic, amazing writing looks like, and I can only dream that one day I''ll have honed my own craft to this level of skill. This book is inspiration bound in paper and ink, and I will never stop loving it.',1643068800000),

Aelin spent the book trying to gather forces together, to build and army but there were so many that didnt make it easy. I was astonished at how many people even within her own circle of people that were not exactly against her but that gave her trouble, that make her life that much harder when they were supposed to be supporting her. It was like, when things got tough, the nice and shiny wore off and they wanted perfection. Lifes not like that, not even in books. It kind of annoyed me, to say the least. I was really shocked at the turn of events too, with what happened at the end, who ended up at the end of the book, coming back at Aelin. Its like we almost came full circle in a way. I should have been expecting it but I wasnt. Shame on me. Im glad we finally got some insight into the past, what happened back when she was a child, and even before that, generations ago what set everything into motion to get to this point. Its nice to finally be in the know, to some extent at least. All in all, I really enjoyed it. And it was a blast to see Rolfe again.

I may or may not be getting addicted to this series. The story follows Adrian''s tough warrior sister Lyss and emotionally conflicted enemy Hal, as well as morally conflicted musician Breon. Their lives intertwine and emotions and goals are inexorably changed, altered, or foiled. While most of the story revolves around Lyss, Hal, and Breon, other characters from the previous book make returns that leave me wondering about how this will all tie together. The characters are my favourite part of the book. Lyss is the kind of girl you''d want leading you in combat and fighting at your side. Hal''s honour and heart make him easy to adore. Breon''s dry humour and suppressed goodness make him layered and engaging. Since much of this story followed military characters, there were a lot of battle and action scenes that got my heart rate up, though nothing was more epic than the final battle and the cliffhanger leading into the next book. I had so much fun reading this sequel, and am dying to see where the third book goes',1645833600000),

It''s been a huge inspiration for me, and I''m sad to see it end, but this finale was worth the wait. Characters old and new returned for a final battle against two vile enemies, and their struggle was one of the most breathtaking things I''ve ever read. It was a nonstop ride that completely filled all of its nearly 1000 pages. The action was heart-pounding, the romances were swoon-worthy, and the ending left me in tears. I can''t get over the strength of these characters. The choices they were willing to make, the sacrifices they did make, it was nothing short of epic and what I expected from this beloved and unconventional court. Aelin, of course, shone like a beacon the entire time and lived up to her name, refusing to bow down and despite her trauma and vulnerabilities, continued to fight to the bitter end with her friends and mate near to her. I could go on and on about how much I love these characters and what they didRowan will always have my heart and is the stuff of dreams, Yrene and Elide had courage beyond what I imaginedbut I was blown away by Manon for her spectacular arc, and Lysandra turned out to be one of the toughest characters in the TOG world. The myths, lore, magic, and battles, were no holds barred. I literally stayed up an extra two hours past my bedtime to keep reading, because I knew I wouldn''t sleep until I reached the ending. It was that impactful, and the ending that intense. I definitely spent the last ten or so pages crying, because I''m sad to see this series and these characters go. Their hardships and trials were nothing short of legendary, which Aelin being one of the most powerful and inspiring women in all of Young Adult fiction.

But then the rest of the book kills it. The supposed assassin goes to court to figure out which enemies of the Royal family to kill. She actually spends a good chunk of her time staring around rooms at people in the wild hopes she will just happen to see the marque that signifies her God wants her to kill someone. She blunders through investigations and is too distracted by the dashing young courtier she had been assigned to watch to bother noticing obvious clues. The romance is grating and unsubtle. A case of lust being wildly mistaken for love. She almost literally falls for the first man she is around outside the convent she has been in for three years.

Everything about this story reeks of tragedy, but by focusing on the journey of four key young people, and even allowing us to cheer against all odds for a love story, infuses in the story a sense of hope even in the darkest of times, human beings have an intrinsic need to seek happiness and find ways to love one another.

I didnt remember putting in a hold for the next one, but the library just informed me it was available, so I started reading. Tamora Pierces characterization and storytelling show in how I recognized the characters and remembered what had come before with the help of small reminders in the text. Book 3, however, is odd. Where the previous two had a main plot plus an overall series plot to drive them, this story deals with the lingering effects of the earlier events. It gives the main character, Alanna, the chance to come into her own. We also see hints of what the next book will involve. This is a middle novel, but dont think that means nothing happens. Alanna goes seeking adventure and finds a different type than she expects, or even recognizes at first. A simple hillman attack in the desert turns deadly because the leader carries a magical sword. Its only with the intervention of the Bazhir that she and Coram survive. The rescue is more from pot to fire as the Bloody Hawk desert tribe decides whether she should die for the crime of masquerading as a man. Nor is this judgment the first challenge she faces. Alannas placed in reacting positions to several events rather than driving the narrative, though her reactions are true to her character. The one major decision she must make is something she avoids, even when given no choice. Her reactions give the book story, teaching the reader, along with Alanna, about the desert tribes and its traditions. We also learn more about the overall political situation between the northerners and the Bazhir among others, along with inspired solutions. Alanna is very much a wish fulfillment main character in some ways. She seems able to rise to any challenge and has the special training or skill to succeed. This could have become annoying but doesnt thanks to bringing the reader along. We see both her process and her struggles. The way Alanna doesnt assume she will succeed helps, too. Nor does everything go smoothly for her with sometimes severe consequences, something that surprised me because Id bought into her perfection. And, of course, her cat Faithful is around to keep her humble with sharp observations and a helping hand. Alanna is never long without friends either, showing another of her strengths. Which brings me to the portrayal of the desert tribes and their customs. There were places where I worried the northerners were coming in to fix things for the Bazhir, and to some degree thats true. But rather than change imposed from outside, key northerners join with the tribe through their actions and as a result of Bazhir traditions. While Alanna challenges the gender roles, apart from a few outliers, her acceptance comes not from her actions as much from the tribes philosophies. I enjoyed how they absorb the deserts nature into their culture. Which brings me to another reason I appreciate Alanna. Shes willing to learn and change as well rather than blindly forcing her views on the Bazhir. I loved the portrayal of the desert tribes, united in their connections to each other and the desert, but also individual in their opinions. This novel holds an odd, but necessary, space in the Song of the Lioness series. Alanna has done the impossible and vanquished her mortal enemy, but she doesnt celebrate that victory. She both doubts her actions and struggles with the lack of a goal. For a book where there isnt a clear main plot, the character growth kept me reading, and the connections made, broken, and remade were lovely. Alanna is a different person by the last page, with a better understanding of herself and the desert people. The Bazhir culture is complex and nuanced, even when addressing tradition and gender roles. Alanna learns to respect their culture even when it conflicts with her views by looking deeper than the surface. Im happy to have reconnected with familiar characters and met new ones. This book stands on the shoulders of the previous two, building on earlier events in unexpected ways. A fitting continuation to the series.',1591401600000),

It is also the conclusion to a series that has become exceedingly popular, birthing its own base of fans that will soon be treated to a movie rendition. Along with that comes a great deal of pressure, certainly for the author but for readers as well. Will the book conclude the series satisfactorily? How will the stories end for these much-beloved characters? The questions are endless and no matter what an author does, there will be readers who love it and others who dont. After concluding Allegiant I feel that Roth ended the Divergent series with loyalty to her vision and its characters, as well as incorporating some ground-shaking surprises that kept the book exciting right to the very end. Tris and Four, along with their former-Dauntless companions, are facing a new world. When a video reveals they are not alone in the world, they must decide if they will seek out unknown possibilities or stay in the only place they have ever known but which is dissolving into rebellion between the factionless and the Allegiant, those who wish to see the factions returned to their previous place of importance. When they do decide to leave they are welcomed into an organization that reveals that their city has been an experiment, an attempt to repair damaged genes and DNA. This ideal of damaged and pure genes will come to consume them and will eventually cause Four, always the sturdiest of the group, to question his self worth. When the survival of their former city becomes endangered Tris and Four, along with old and new alliances, will make a final stand against enemies inside and outside of the city, one that will only come to fruition through forgiveness and sacrifice. I was one of those readers who was unsure how it would end, but I will say that after finishing Allegiant I believe Roth has done an admirable job of bringing such a popular series to its end. I had some issues with Insurgent specifically that I had a hard time keeping track of the characters and what their purpose was in the story line, along with finding the story somewhat fractured but none of those were present in Allegiant. All of the characters played crucial roles in the progression of the story. Fours struggle was one of the more interesting evolutions to read. In Insurgent we watched Tris suffer from the aftermath of her actions, but the uncertainty Four experiences is of a completely different nature. Roth has turned the former dynamic on its head Tris is the individual who is certain and unswayable, while this time around it is Four who questions his purpose. The tension between them is different than the previous novel, but it too stems from the changes in the environment around them. One of the discussions I had with a friend was the change in narrative. Unlike the previous two books, parts of this story are told from Fours point of view. At first it seems a little disjointed but by the end of the novel you can understand why Roth decided to take this route. It is also interesting to take into account that Roth published an short online novella about Four during the summer of 2013 and more will be coming in the near future. This might also explain why Roth made Fours a voice a much more central aspect for this final installment. Of the series, Divergent is still my favourite. I loved the factions, the way in which they structured society and placed characters in defined categories according to their strengths and values. I found the characters did the most developing in that book as well. However, I do admire how Roth ended her series, taking a route that I didnt think she would and possibly risking upsetting a few readers in doing so. For that fact alone, I will say that Allegiant is a fitting finish to the Divergent series. The Divergent series is often compared to or recommended to those who enjoyed the Hunger Games and while they are different, they do contain some of the same themes, emotions and challenges that have made both so popular with readers of all ages. Both are social commentaries in their own right and both declare that people, however willing or unwilling they may be, can make a difference. Its a message worth relaying to teens and even adults. Allegiant concludes a thrilling series with a memorable ending and a lingering respect for the choices Roth has her characters make.',1588636800000),

As a woman of color, I was surprised by the insightful observations brought up in this book. How laws and treatment are different depending on the color of your skin. It was also good to see that Nita''s mother is not the insensitive hard-ass we met in book one. Well...not as hard. She''s still all secrets and rough edges. Every time Nita''s has a plan, the backlash is catastrophic. It will be interesting to see how her next endeavor goes in book #3, especially since she will be working with someone who she not only can''t trust, but also hates her.',1632182400000),

I was really drawn to the Irish twist to fae lore and I have never seen that genre mixed with steampunk which brought out a really rich and complex environment. Aileana is a classical strong and bad ass warriordebutante walking the line between the life of a lady and that of a warrior hell bent of destroying the creature that killed her mother and the rest of the faery race. Ultimately she''s a puppet to her own fate and despite wanting desperately to choose her own fate she continues to do exactly what is expected and destined for. In the end she honestly does nothing to against expectation whether it comes to her father, her engagement, or even the war with the fae. Her character is fueled by rage and guilt making her one dimensional and predictable. Aileana is ultimately overshadowed by her mentor and partner, Kiaran MacKay who even described as stoic and unfeeling block ice, has more depth and interest in his character. The mystery behind why he hunts his own kind with Aileana, his past and his conflicted displays of emotions cover for the repeating drawl of Aileana''s emotions and conflicts.

The feels killed me and to be honest I can''t really explain this novel in just a few paragraphs. I was worried that Crown of Midnight might suffer the second book syndrome but Crown of Midnight was even better then Throne of Glass. When reading Throne of Glass it took me a while to get into, but once I did, I was hooked but when I began the sequel I was hooked from the get go. Crown of Midnight shows a more in depth, grittier, assassin like side of Celaena. All the scars from her past came to surface and she was a lot darker. Saying this I really enjoyed seeing this side of her because it allowed me as a reader to connect with both her arrogant, flirty and brave side but her also her vulnerable side. And I found this to be a lot more realistic. Once again I was drawn to the fantasy aspect of this novel. It gets creepier and creepier. Crown of Midnight had sad moments, action packed moments, jaw dropping moments and swoon worthy moments. Let''s just say that this book is for Chaol fans and thank god for that. FEELS OVERLOAD. The world building in Crown of Midnight is spot on. I was drawn in from page one and my mind didnt want to be anywhere else. As I mentioned, the pacing in Crown of Midnight is fantastic. I hate slow paced novels and this one had the right mix of everything to keep me on my toes and no boring parts were to be found. I gobbled it up in a day and was left with a major book hangover once Id finished it. All though this novel was awesome I felt that the ending just kinda hit me. A big reveal happened literally on the last page and it was a OMG WHAAA I CANT EVEN BELIEVE FEELS OVERLOAD moment but it felt rushed to me. It wasnt lead into, it just happened and threw me a bit. I was then like Sarah why must you mess with my emotions? Talk about cliffhanger. But I think everything was turned up a notch in the sequel and was done perfectly so. The hinted romance took a bigger part, there were more feels, more sadness, more action and more scary weird creatures. Crown of Midnight just made my love for the series turn up a notch too. I REALLY enjoyed Throne of Glass and I would have been happy if it was of the same standard, but instead Maas delivered so much more and knocked my socks off. Its a really gripping series that has something for everyone and I can see a lot of people loving it as well. So basically if you are like me who was hesitant and nervous to begin this series....

I was surprised by the romantic elements that were woven in but they added yet another level of attraction to the book for me. I will warn that this book is set up for a series in that there is a big cliffhanger Just when I thought the book was ending, it kicked back up again and then quickly ended. I will be reading the next book in the series because this book was just that good. It had supernatural elements yet dealt with elements of the human condition. It was a roller coaster of events and the violence is very graphic. One scene in particular had me literally covering my eyes. The characters are aggressively tested physically and mentally. As a result, their bonds are stronger and they set their eyes stronger on the prize. There were selfless acts, there were selfish acts. All of their pasts come back to haunt them and they are even stronger for it. The complex maze of this book was simply magical.

Eventually though, I gave up that series and decided to dig into Six of Crows even though I had not read the Grisha trilogy in advance. And I am happy that I did because Six of Crows was an easy read that pulled me in rather quickly. In Six of Crows we follow a group of six criminals from a gang called the Dregs, and when their leader, Kaz, gets a job that would change their lives forever, he cant say no, despite the job being as impossible as it gets. So, in this book, we get to come along on the quest as they set out to break into one of the most secure prisoners in Fjerda. Theres a lot of things that I really enjoy in this book, but also a few things that slightly annoyed me. But for the most part this is a great read and the way the author has managed to keep the reader invested in all three characters and their separate POVs is impressive, not once did I feel like any of the characters were unnecessary or flat. Every character is well developed with interesting backstory and theres also a lot going on in their relationships and thanks to the separate POVs you get a very intimate connection to each an ever characters emotions and reasons to what they do. Its, like I said, beautifully crafted and the writing too is beautiful and vivid. The wordbuiling is great and Bardugo manages to incorporate details of the world and the scenery in the story without it feeling heavy with information. It all flows very well, and as I read it was easy to picture the scenes. The plot was interesting, full of twists and turns and seeing the teams job take shape from the eyes of multiple POVs made for a very interesting read and also gave the heist that sense of mystery and surprise that were used to seeing on tv and in movies. As for the things that I didnt quite like it was not bad enough to really make a difference in the overall rating, but it was still things that stuck out to me. The first being that I felt like the heist sometimes got overshadowed by massive bits of backstory. The backstory itself didnt bother me because they were interesting and great, and they made me understand and connect with the character a lot more, but I didnt feel like they were necessary for the story in that elaborated manor they had been written in, less information had been enough and kept the pacing of the main plot more consistent. So, even though I enjoyed learning about the characters pasts and the reasons they ended up in the gang, I would have preferred more focus on the heist itself. The second thing is the beginning. It was unnecessary and pointless. Why make us invested in Joost and Anya just to basically never mention them again? I get the point of showing what the drug could do, but there must have been a better way to do it. The third thing is related to the Fjerdans and primarily their language. The Fjerdans are, according to what Ive read from interviews with Leigh Bardugo, heavily influenced by Scandinavia, and more specifically Sweden and Norway. As a swede, I can totally see that, and I knew that it is a fictional language and that my own language has been used as inspiration. But I couldnt help feel a bit thrown off when there was suddenly words that I knew from my own language being used when there was so many other words used that didnt fit at all with the way wed use those words. Its hard to explain, and truly it doesnt really matter since its fiction and not real, but it was something that stood out to me, like a hiccup that broke the flow of my reading. I think it would have bothered me less if the Fjerdans had actually spoken any of the Scandinavian languages, or at least had a more reasonable structure to their sentences and words that would have fit well with the use of actual words from our language. And in this same line are the names of the Fjerdan Drskelle. There were typical Scandinavian names at a lot of the times, but then there were these names that stood out and didnt fit in with the rest wed been told. But, Im not going to let any of this affect the rating since this is just a personal thing that most likely wouldnt bothered anyone else, and if does not in any way affect the intensity and greatness of the story. So, overall, this book will get a solid 45 stars from me, and I cant wait to dig into the sequel.

The book introduces us to our main character, Clary Fray, who is thrown into a world that she didn''t even know existed  a world of vampires, werewolves, warlocks, and demons. Now, if I suddenly saw a demon walking down the street, I might freak out a little bit  ok, a lot  and I would definitely start asking some serious questions of the people involved. But Clary just seems totally fine with this new realization. She is so ridiculously accepting of her new life that it is pretty unbelievable. Also, I found that there was a lot of missing information about the entire Shadowhunter world in this book. Example Jace and Alec are said to be parabatai, but there is barely any description of what that means or how that partnership came to be. I knew about the Shadowhunters because I have read Clare''s other books, but I think if City of Bones was the first book I had read about this world, I probably would have been a little confused. Maybe there is more description in the upcoming books and I just haven''t read it yet. There are two things about Cassandra Clare''s books that I really love. She always manages to include a character who loves books in her works. It''s like a little nod to her audience of book nerds and it makes me smile. Also, she is an author that really creates quite a diverse cast of characters. She is not afraid to introduce all different types of people to her readers, including LGBTQ characters, and I really respect that.',1599609600000),

Even more than before, Chain of Iron is a story about family, friends, and romance. Clare spends plenty of time with each character so the full impact of their arcs and choices are seen through. It truly was breathtaking to follow these strange families, both of blood and bond, on harrowing adventures that led to shocking twists and unexpected revelations. All of the characters were back in their elements. Cordelia has such a noble, brave heart, she really does seem like a fabled warrior of old. She is too good for this world and I miss her story already. Seeing James battle with his emotions and abilities is always compelling, and he showed a truly romantic side of himself. Matthew''s arc is tragic and made for some surprising moments with James. Thomas and Anna are still two of my favourites, one trying to do the right thing while the other lives freely and for herself. Gets tangled in adventurous webs and uses incredible power. Even Grace, who I was never overly fond of for her actions, has a complicated backstory revealed that made me sympathize with her. Clare is a master of weaving beautiful words and detail to make every romantic scene more impactful. Little things carry heavy meaning and are enough to make readers swoon. Which makes it all the more devastating when she breaks the hearts of our beloved heroes. There were some shocking twists and expert reveals that I never saw coming and am eager to see how the plot lines round out. Since much of the plot revolved around the romantic and personal relationships of the main cast, at times the actual murder mystery plot felt a bit slow. But Clare is so good at making her characters feel like real people that I always found myself wanting to go back to the romance. This is a solid edition to the series, and fans of romance will find plenty to fall in love with here. Clare is an amazing writer and I definitely recommend this sequel and the series as a whole',1637625600000),

The end felt very flat to me, despite being emotionally charged and frustrating. Without spoiling, I will say that I hate a book that hinges on misunderstandings to propel the romantic plot forwards, it feels frustrating and avoidable, like it was done because the author felt as though they had to keep you coming back for more and didn''t know how to keep you invested otherwise. The disappointing thing about that for me is that I was already invested in these characters- I didn''t need a clear cut reason to come back for the next book, the vibrant characters alone did that. I think a bit of emotional payoff would have been really nice to see in this sequel after Chain of Gold left us with so little, so I can only hope that Chain of Thorns will deliver in a way Chain of Iron did not. Also no idea what was up with how choppy the POV cuts felt, maybe its a symptom of recently reading other split POV books that did it much more elegantly than Chain of Iron did, but it would have felt like a much smoother read without being broken up. Over all, the main plot line was satisfying, and answered questions leftover from COG. loved the direction Lucie and Jesse''s story took, and Grace''s character arc was perhaps the most compelling out of all the characters.

I was worried about the characters not being distinct, but right off the bat the POVs were distinctive and all very much their own character and easy to follow along with. My second worry was family ties and keeping everyone straight. All the major families are back and with at least two kids to boot. That''s a lot of characters to keep straight, but the first few chapters have sorted everyone out rather quickly. It will also be interesting to have a cast of characters with siblings. So far the Blackthorns and Lightwoods are the only shadow hunter MCs that are not only children. I''me very excited to see how that dynamic plays out. In the opening chapters we are introduced to quite the gang. The boys of the major families have formed their own sort of group that seems to have each other''s backs while also having a grand time of things. Their easy camaraderie reminded me that of past or present shadowhunter relationships, but more because of the size of the group. James seems to have Will''s looks but take after Tessa and is hopelessly in love with Grace, only no one knows and she didn''t tell him she was moving to London. Meanwhile, Cordelia Carstairs has just arrived in London as well after a scandal and is hopelessly in love with James herself. Although we know who ends up marrying who, this already seems like a tragic mess and like it will be a fun to watch it all play out. Above all this though, there is the mystery of why there are fewer and fewer demons in London. The writing seems to be in line with more of The Infernal Devices Trilogy than that of The Mortal Instruments. It feels a tad more mature. The descriptions of London were on par as per the TID trilogy and it seems as if we''ll be exploring the backdrop of London more than that of the previous trilogy which will be exciting.

I really dontBut regardless, I picked it up last week and it was all I could think about. At first, I was expecting something a little like The Hunger Games but in a different period. Its not really like that though. Im glad to say its completely different. At least to me it was. Celaena Sardothien is a tough kick butt heroine. Trained to be an assassin since she was eight years old by the King of Assassins, she has learned a lot. Now she is an eighteen year old who is smart, caring, a little arrogantwell no scratch that she is really arrogant about her skills and reputation as an assassin. After being imprisoned in the salt mines of Endovier for a year, Dorian Havilliard, Crown Prince of Adarlan gives her a way for her to earn her freedom Out of 23 competitors, Celaena is the only woman in the bunch. But of course she doesnt find that the least bit intimidating. Though she is confident in what she can do, the competition is far from a cakewalk even for someone like Celaena and soon people start ending up dead. Worried not only about her safety, but those of her friends and people, she realizes that she must do whatever it takes to stop the evil thats begun all while fighting to become the Kings Champion. Some of my favorite scenes include Dorian and Celaena. They have such witty banter. These two could arguetalk all day and I would never tire of it. There chemistry is great. Im secretly hoping that they get together in the end. I kept telling myself just one more chapter, one more chapter. I was so enthralled by the story that I quickly lost track of time and before I knew it, it was 4 in the morning. I havent gotten that into a book in forever. The pace of the story was good and there is plenty of action, adventure, deception, and solid characters that kept me more than a little entertained. I. Loved. It. Now I am on to the second book, to discover what happens next. If you enjoy fantasy or historical fiction with some actionadventure than I would definitely recommend this book in an instant.',1602288000000),

Almost a 4.The thing I enjoyed the most about this book was not the good fight scenes, or magic or slow building mystery, or kickass female lead character...but the budding triangle. And I hate that sort of thing. Why I enjoy it this time is that I felt the strongest point of the book was the characters and their development. None were flat or too predictable. They had distinct personalities and all pretty likable. And importantly....their actions and reactions make sense and don#039t feel forced. I enjoyed all of their interactions. So I find myself rooting for all of them. All of their interactions were interesting and never boring. I look forward to future books and how they develop as well as discovering more about Celaena and her history and importance in the fight for the future of the kingdom coming.The next Major point for me was Celaena herself. I like that she was this trained killer, and very hard due to her life experiences, but she also had this vulnerability about her that made her relatable. Sometimes in the quest to create this tough, badass female character...the character is made too hard. Like steel...and kind of become removed from the reader. I like that she still had this part of her that like pretty dresses and a good looking face, and who was damaged and made mistakes, and sometimes wanted to run and hide and quithellipshe wasnrsquot not perfect...they all made for an interestin',1629417600000),

The main characters are faced with one clue after the other in an absurd way, characters that are not even the ones there were in the first chapter of this saga, and their change takes place too quickly, without a logical reason or a justifiable amount of time. I directly avoid comments on the teen-drama between Teresa and Thomas. In addition to this, however, nothing happens in the book, information are given but aren''t enough to answer the all the questions that everyone made during and after reading The Maze Runner.

They are both great characters and have excellent if sometimes volatile chemistry. Both are stubborn in their beliefs, yet the more time they spend with one another, the more they question what they believe and why they believe it. This also leads to a slow burn romance, which Jensen does very, very well. I know I''ll be constantly rooting for them in future books. I also look forward to learning more of Marcus'' men, and all of the side characters and villains. I am going to say right now that Servius is bae and needs to stay safe and alive. While the characters are the major draw, the action is also frequent and exciting. I really loved the high seas adventures, with one godly battle literally causing my eyes to widen.

Thank you In no way does this affect my rating or review. All included quotes have been taken from an ARC and may not match the finished publication. The sea is a beast more fearsome than even the Lusca. But we don''t need to rule it. We need only for it to trust us. Work with us. Be partners. The island kingdom of Visidia is made of up many. Each island nation within have their own, special magic that they use and practice. Among elemental, enchantment, time, restoration, and curse magic is soul magic. Soul magic, Animancy is a peculiar, yet awful magic that only resides within the royal line. Unlike everyone else, royalty cannot choose which magic they desire to learn. Being the only heir to the throne that wields soul magic, Amora Montara will soon ascend the throneif she can pass the test proving to her people that she has mastered her magic. To her horror, she learns that it masters her when she fails to keep control while exacting judgement on a criminal. Temporarily imprisoned, Amora awaits her fate. Usually, failing the test results in a swift execution. When her betrothed visits, the son of a diplomat isnt far behind, and offers to break her out and help her prove she can rule in turn for something else. Terrified that her people wont give her another chance, she and Ferrick follow whom they soon find out to be someone else. The pirate Bastian has wandered the ocean since he was a young boy. Cursed to his ship, hes lost the magic he could once wield. Privy to a plot much running deeper than Amora could ever suspect, he leads the duo on a nail-biting excursion across the isles to frigid waters where the home to where cursed magic lay, Zudoh. Having been banned from the kingdom previously, Zudoh is known by reputation. A terrifying ruler there began practicing more than one magic, which has always been deeply unacceptable. Forcing his people to do the same, Kaven had lost the support of Amoras father, the king, long ago. Theres no rationalizing with a man who craves nothing but power. Much of this information is new to Amora. The more she travels, the more she discovers that she had been kept in the dark. The entire picture is unclear, and she can no longer feign negligence. What she uncovers is a truth more unpleasant than she could have ever guessed. But even our idols--even those we want to love and trust more than anything--can let us down. All The Stars And Teeth is an action-packed ride riddled with earth-shattering secrets. There is certainly an addictive quality to this sort of story. An unlikely team bands together to work fix a major problem. The reader walks directly next to Amora, experiencing life and finding out truths along with her. Naturally a steadfast and duty-driven character, Amora learns what it is like to second-guess herself and that which she believes. Raised as royalty, shes always willingly sacrificed herself for the greater-good. However, when the grounding for her standards is shaken, Amora must learn to fight for what she believes is right. Shes more than her blood. Opposite of her character lies Bastion. Life as a pirate isnt a kind one. Having to fend for himself, and living a relatively isolated life while cursed to his ship has forced him to grow into a complicated character. Im a pirate...All my life Ive had to play that role just to survive, and the more I played, the more the lines got blurred of who I really was. All The Stars And Teeth investigates the truth that when faced with adversity, there are two options ignore the truth and become hostile, or accept that you were wrong and work to right that wrong. Bastion, Ferrick, and the mermaid Vataea each encounter this in their journey in different ways. Puzzling out solutions together is what makes this team grow and their dynamics so interesting. I really enjoyed this story. It was easy to get swept up and away with all of the different elements and the setting. I loved many aspects of the world building, but desired more time in each place to really get a feel for how the culture shifts between each island. As most YA novels, I found that the lack of character description is present, and I wished I could have gotten a better grasp of the physical attributes of each character besides their hair and eye color. Even so, this was an entertaining story, to say the least. Vulgarity Minimal. Sexual content Passionate kissing. Violence Quite a bit. My Rating ????',1594080000000),

It begins in the same way that Kenjis novella, Shadow Me, ended. This is disappointing because thats actually the only part I really thought was important to take away from Shadow Me, so now I just think that novella is completely unnecessary, to be honest. SighI almost feel like changing my rating for that novella. Back to this book, so the first maybe 25 of the book is mostly is Kenjis POV, with snippets of Warner and Juliettes memories from the past. Its not until later that we get anything from Warner or Juliette in the present. As we learn more about the past, I think it only makes Warner and Juliettes relationship that much more special. They truly are meant to be together. After reading this book, I think it would be difficult for anyone to remain on Team Adam, if there were even any remaining at this point. The story itself was good and very captivating. I am obviously a fan of Tahereh Mafis writing style and she has yet to fail to captivate me. I felt like the middle of the book was very good and I didnt want to put it down. The beginning had me extremely curious and anxious to find out more. The ending, however, was just a bit cheesy and didnt do much for me. No big cliffhanger this time, like we were left with after Restore Me, but thats okay. Overall, I really enjoyed this book. While it wasnt one of my favourite books in the story, it was still really good. Im looking forward to continuing the story in the next book',1610496000000),

Also one of the complaints was that it was confusing when Juliette changed her name, I feel like people are nick picking at that point. Its clearly stated at the beginning of the chapters her past and current name. It just makes sense with the storyline and where the series is going that she changes her name. Anyways my point is that when I started this book I was terrified it wasnt going to live up to how amazing I think this series is, I was happily surprised and this book was amazing',1621209600000),

When the Quatra Fleet Academy starts taking students in from outside Tri, for the first time since its inception, it does so to promote diversity in its student body, something that has political ramifications in and out of the Academy. Cormak and Arran come from the poorer Settler planets essentially, the ones colonized after the capital Tri and are out to prove themselves to the world, and to show, like many of the other Settler kids, that they are as good as the elitist Tridians. Orelia is a spy come to infiltrate the Academy, and Vesper is the daughter of the commanding officer of the Academy and has the burden of proving herself as a serious candidate and not just there because of nepotism. The major part of the novel is about their first term in the ultra-competitive Academy, where weekly rankings of squads keep them on their toes. With the addition of Settler kids, the rivalries are intensified, along with the subtle anti-immigrant sentiment going around that shadows most interactions between the elite kids and the poor ones. The four main characters alternate in chapters, and we get to see their personal struggles as they face threats from alien forces, prejudices within and without, challenges, and doubts. Cormak has an additional secret because he is impersonating this dead brother and he does some shady stuff to hide it. Vesper is a neurotic mess, partly from bullying, and partly from having to live up to her mothers expectations she also has to contend with the lure of substance abuse. Orelia has the classic spys dilemma  she is getting close to the people she is targeting and questioning whether what she is doing is right. Arran questions the reality of his relationship with Dash, who is the son of a prominent bigoted noble. The book does the school arc very well, and the writing and characterization is light years ha ahead of her debut, The 100 which I reread recently so it made for a good comparison and has a more layered plot. But it also lacks much action, expect maybe a couple of key scenes of simulated conflict, and one battle with an alien spaceship. As of this novel, there are still a lot of things not brought forward, like the nature of Tridian society which seems monolithic at this point, with a couple of outliers, and why there are no signs of a resistant movement, and also the other big Sylvan presence. The stakes are lower than what I expected, and most of it was easygoing. It does have a hell of a cliffhanger after a nicely resolved climax, so it has that going for it, to get us excited for the next novel.',1634860800000),

Everything else? Shocks and twists on every page and an ending meant to shatter reader hearts and break souls. But I can''t deny how much I loved it. I''ve never been able to resist Amie and Jay''s collaborative masterpieces, and this is no exception. Just when I believed they couldn''t make me feel deeper in love with our young heroes of Squad 312, they did so through charm and will and courage and sacrifice. Too many sacrifices if you ask me, since many characters paid a steeper price than others. I love the crew so much, each member stealing a piece of my heart, none more so than Kal. I adore him and his arc completely shattered me. There is no shortage of action and tension and breathless moments through out the book, and the twists made my head spin. Nothing is ever as it seems and the characters struggle with what is right and what is worth fighting for. I don''t know if there is a crew in the galaxy with the odds more stacked against them. The writing styles blend seamlessly and make for some charming, fun, and swoon worthy moments. I may not forgive Amie and Jay for the ending because cliffhangers, let''s be real, but they have proved to not only be formidable talents, but expert storytellers who sweep readers off their feet and make you care about a group of misfits who are a perfect family. It is going to be agony to wait another year to find out what happened, but I am willing to wait and bite my nails in the mean time.

There were also plenty of plot twists and actions that kept my breathless and needing to know what happened next. I also loved all of the characters.

My favourite characters were of course Siege and Jax. I absolutely adore them and want to see more of them. The romances happened quickly, but I was fond of the tenderness and drama of them.

Before I begin, CONFESSION TIME Carve the Mark is my first book by Veronica Roth  I didnt read, and honestly have no intention of reading the Divergent series. A few years ago, when I started blogging, I read a spoiler about the ending of Allegiant and it made reading the whole series kind of pointless. Before I started reading Carve The Mark, or even before my copy arrived, I heard a lot of people saying that things in this book were truly offensive. I spoke to a bunch of people over the internet, and learned what it was all about. Although a large number of people WERE saying that they were boycotting the book I a dont engage in book hate and b had already made a commitment to Harper Collins that I would review this book for them which I would never back out on. Truth be told, I enjoyed the book. A LOT. I will be talking about MY OPINIONS about the controversies this book contains below, but I will review it first. In a galaxy ruled by the Assembly, the planet of Thuve is on the brink of Civil War. Known mostly for their production of Hushflower, which is used for numerous medical and educational purposes, it has two warring people  the Thuveists and the Shotet. All planets have three Oracles  one Falling, one Sitting and one Rising who see the various futures for their planets and all the people in them. Over the galaxy, there are nine fate-favoured families, whose fates remain mostly the same in all possible futures. Cyra Noavek, sister to the Shotet Sovereign, and inflictor of pain with a single touch is one of the Fate Favoured Children. As is Akos Kereseth, son of a Thuveist hushflower farmer and the sitting oracle. Determined to change the fate the oracles have seen for him, Cyras older brother kidnaps Akos and his brother, Eijeh and nobodys life is ever the same. I found it REALLY EASY to slip into this world. After just the first chapter, which was a little strange, it was REALLY fun to get to know more about the Galaxy and the planets in it. There were three MAJOR things that I loved about this book  1. THE WORLD BUILDING Although the origin of the Current itself was vague, EVERYTHING else about this world was REALLY well described. When I was in Shotet where most of the book is set or even in Pitha, I FELT IT ALL. The scavenged lifestyle, the savagery, the tradition. It felt like they were a real people with a real country and real beliefs that they upheld, MORE than any book in ever. 2. ISAE AND CISI While they dont show up until we reach the end, and we dont even see much of them, for some reason they TOTALLY captured my heart? I love it when LGBT couples are openly accepted in a fantasy book  it make me REALLY happy. 3. CYRA AND AKOSS ROLES In most books, the guy is the alpha male and the girl is the clueless dainty little thing. While NEITHER of them were clueless, I felt like they didnt follow traditional roles book tropes and were INDEPENDENT characters struggling with their own flaws. Some of the things I didnt like in this book was the romance between Cyra and Akos, when it began. I thought that they were BETTER friends, but I slowly warmed up to their relationship. Im not a shipper, but Ive made my peace with it. Another thing that annoyed me was Sifa Kereseth, Akoss mom. I understand duty and being ruthless, but HOW CAN YOU BE BOTH? All in all, a book I REALLY enjoyed  a fast paced, brutal fantasy with beautiful world building and characters 4 stars. I fully acknowledge that people have been hurt by Veronica Roth''s words, and I cannot apologize deeply enough for it. I''m so sorry for any injustice you have undergone or hurt you have felt. I do, however, want to tell people that if they WERE ARE interested in the book, they should still read it and THEN if you find it offensive, SPEAK UP because your voice MATTERS and speaking up with all your facts correct is IMPORTANT. I still apologize to the people hurt by this book. If there were any other issues YOU found in the book, I haven''t heard of them, so please feel free to talk to me about them.  I asked people on Instagram what the controversy was, and I had conversations with over 10 people, and found out about the TWO MAJOR issues everyone is claiming this books has. I also noticed that a LOT of these people HADN''T EVEN READ THE BOOK, and had simply bought into the negative hype. The first was that the planet that the book was set on had a half black population that behaved savagely and a white population that was peaceful. WHILE the MAIN CHARACTERS, Cyra is described as dark skinned and Akos is fair skinned, it is NOWHERE mentioned that the ENTIRE POPULATION of either nation is black or white. The second was a little harder. In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, Veronica Roth said that the ''gift'' the Cyra had was based off of Chronic Pain.

The action was plentiful as the characters worked to get their revolution rising and wage their final attack on Levana. There were very tense moments, especially near the end when beloved cyborg Cinder is truly alone against her enemies. There was also plenty of emotions as true feelings are revealed, secrets are unveiled, and characters need to find their courage to face their greatest challenges and enemies. I felt the worst for Scarlet and Wolfe, who faced serious hardships that threatened to break them. That said, Cinder definitely worked her way through trial after trial after trial. As for Winter and Jacin, well, I still felt Jacin was a bit too much of a jerk most of the time, though he was definitely a cinnamon roll when it came to Winter. As for the Princess herself, I found her to be immensely fascinating. She is a character I would have loved to spend more time with.

This story is not for the faint of heart as the tox causes monstrous deformations in the host bodies- both physical and psychological. And the author does not hold back on causing every single one of her characters pain Nor is this story for the grammar police. The prose is absolutely stunning in the poetic sense. The author goes ALL IN on voice, throwing grammar conventions out the window. The result is almost a cinematic experiencevirtual reality, at times, and I think it is completely fitting for this story.

Wilder Girls will draw you in, softy whispering tendrils creeping through your mind and thorny vines entangling your heart and capturing it completely in this beautiful, eerily dark and haunting, yet hopeful book. The cover is the first thing to be noticed. With its gorgeous yet subtly unsettling artwork, it will immediately catch your eyes. These unforgettable characters live and breathe on the page, from Hettys stubborn unwillingness to give up on Byatt, to Reeses sharpness and burning hair. The chapters narrated by Byatt were heartrending. Even minor characters felt brought to life. The girls struggle to stay alive in the treacherous shadowy place their lives had become was darkly fascinating, as was the tension between an obvious bond and caring between all the girls, yet also a mentality of everyone being willing to do whatever it takes to survive. Not only the plot and the characters shine in this book. Rory Powers writing gleams and shimmers, able to shift from flowery introspective prose to heart-pounding action scenes. This book wouldnt have been hurt by another few hundred pages. Unfortunately, it is as of now, a standalone, we will have to make do with the ending we were given, which is just as beautiful and captivating as the rest of the book. Although open-ended, it is a satisfying close to the tale. I think we will just have to assume that all turns out well for our beloved wilder girls.

And it was. I was expecting more though. More horror and more chaos and more young women bucking authority. I kept seeing Wilder Girls by Rory Power all over the socials and people were giving it outstanding reviews. So I was expecting more. I kept seeing it being compared to Lord of the Flies. The young women dont go against the two older women in charge and they dont take over the house. They go along with not having enough food to eat, no medications, being cold, and the fear of not knowing what will happen next. It isnt until Byatt is taken to the locked wing because shes deteriorated so badly that two of the girls finally escape the contained area to find her. And then, finally, in the last quarter of the book the girls start to fight back but only because an unnatural creature forces them too. And still only Hetty and Reese question the status quo as they try to escape, leaving all the other girls behind. Often with horror there isnt a lot or any backstory. You get thrown right into the action. The main characters are trying to stay alive. And theres no time for backstory. Only going forward, either to their death or to be the final girl. But with Wilder Girls since everyone was laying around the house and the only horror was the changes in their bodies granted, they were major and sometimes deadly changes I needed more backstory about the disease. And then towards the end, which came really quickly, after such a slow beginning, we finally learn a little about the disease, but it felt like just a teeny tiny blip in the story. And once again, I needed more. An interesting concept with lots of potential but I needed more.',1634860800000),

Needless to say, Wilder Girls started out interesting. I thought I was going to like it especially when I liked the relationships between certain characters more than the characters themselves. Unfortunately, Wilder Girls just wasnt a book for me. I think Wilder Girls wouldve been a book I might have enjoyed if we were still in the Maze Runner era or the era where dystopia YA was still pretty popular. Right now, I am just not feeling it. I didnt feel like I enjoyed reading this book despite the authors beautiful writing. Now, dont get me wrong, this book was pretty awesome for a debut YA novel. However, Id say the writing saved this book but the story did not. Now that Im a bit older, Im more conscious about the books Im reading. I like to think about the where, why, and the hows of what Im reading. I like to think deep or beyond what was being portrayedshowed in the story. In Wilder Girls, the reader does not get all the answers or the answers werent wrapped up in a nice way. In fact, it was pretty messy to the point that Im actually doubting these characters or whether they know or understand what was going on. There had also been a point where some characters knew what was happening but it just made ZERO sense to me on how they arrived to that conclusion. It just didnt make sense how they would understand the science behind the Tox just by looking at diagrams and scientific information. I cant even recall a time the girls in the boarding school were actually studying. They were just hunting, trying to survive, etc. There really wasnt enough backstory or substantial backstory for me to even understand what was happening. At the same time, I dont know what the meaning is behind this story. This book seemed to be purely plot based just to show a horror and queer story. There might be some character development but it hadnt been major for it to have affected the story definitely not like a character driven type of story. I couldnt find anything substantial in the book besides the relationships. All Im saying is that, while Im reading this book, I cant help but think whats the point? All in all, this was a slow and less cohesive story with a pretty cover but ultimately it just wasnt for me.',1583193600000),

It centers around three best friends Hetty, Byatt, and Reese in the aftermath of a quarantine. Sent to the Raxter School for Girls eighteen months ago, Hetty and her friends are now just trying to survive the Tox, the mysterious illness infecting Raxter Island. Without enough food or supplies, the girls try to stay sane while the Tox spreads, killing the girls one by one. But when Byatt disappears, Hetty will do anything to find her. But the deeper she digs, the more disturbing truths she finds. I devoured this book in one night. Part sci-fi thriller, part heart-warming story of friendship, it pulls the reader deep into the world of Raxter Island. Incredibly fast-paced, it slowly reveals its mysteries to you. Its told alternating the first-person between Hetty and Byatt. I thoroughly enjoyed both the characters viewpoints. I enjoyed formulating theories about the Tox. Presented as a mysterious illness, it affects each person differently. As cool as it was, it was equal parts horrifying. Just when you thought you figured out what was really going on, it threw you another curveball.

Neal Shusterman is a true master with the words and some of this scenes left me speechless with wonder. It was wonderful to re-enter the incredible and unique world the author created. That said, the story moved slowly and while it introduced new characters and adapted with consequences from the previous books events, it moved at a slow place. I didn''t see as many of older characters as I would have liked. And the ending... was not what I expected. The story carried heavy themes and had some great twists, especially when it came to Greyson, who had a fantastic storyline and whom I was completely endeared to. I also loved Jeri, who refused to fit into any mould and who knew how to handle whatever was thrown their way. I always loved seeing Rowan and Citra, but I was surprised at just how little they appeared, and expected them to do a bit more, especially Rowan. That said, his character arc led him to a huge twist I didn''t expect. Goddard and Faraday had two compelling story arcs, though Goddard appeared more than Faraday. As for the ending... I admit it was a surprise, but I''m not sure how I feel about the message it leaves. That said, maybe I just need to think on it more. Still, there is not question Shusterman is a master of storytelling and craft, and this series was unlike anything I ever read. I adore it and while the third book didn''t quite turn out how I imagined, I never stopped loving it. A must read',1602288000000),

I am not a minor or young reader but I love the series and would be perfect for young adult to adult reader. This whole series The Sorcerer''s Ring is one of the best fantasyfiction series I have ever read. And if you like Magic, Romance, friendship and fighting through adversity you have found a great series. I would even say that The Sorcerer''s Ring series makes other books seem dull and slow. I am a fantasy book fanatic and it is the main type of book series I stick with. I don''t write many reviews, but Morgan Rice''s The Sorcerer''s Ring series has made me want to write reviews. The character Thor and the other characters draw you into their situations and events. There is struggle, battle, justice, love, life, caring, magic and so much more In the whole book series. I could go on but I don''t want to give away the books story and events. If you read books then buy the series and Morgan Rice''s other book, you will love them as much as I do. The books are a mush for any Fantasy reader and even for those who want some romance and some action. The best book, author and series ever. Get the books and enjoy. Thanks for reading this review.

Non dans cette rvolution et dans le coeur de chaque personne il y a de l amour,de la compassion mais aussi de la tristesse, de la haine et de la violence.

Are they human, Luxen or something else? On a night out, the club Evie is at is raided and everything changes for her. Swept into a world she thought she new, Evie will have to figure out who her friends and enemies are pretty quick to survive what is coming. The Darkest Star was a slow burn read, meaning that you get to know the characters a little bit more and are reintroduced to Luc and some of the other characters from previous books. Evie is the main protagonist in this book and she is really quite ordinary ordinary in style, language and interests but I definitely think that is part of her appeal and makes her more believable. Her relationship with Luc is a slow starting one and you see their relationship develop as they spend more time together and truths come out. Luc on the other hand comes across as mysterious, sometimes dark and utterly handsome. He definitely gives Evie a lot to think about. What is also good to note is that JLA has made Luc a really likeable yet often flawed characterhe isnt perfect and that is refreshing when it comes to reading YA novels. He hasnt always made the right choices and he owns that. This book is action packed with a hint of witty banter and snarky comments throughout and enough of a back-story that you wouldnt have to have read previous series to understand what is going on. There are also some true teen dramas such as falling in love, bullies and angst which I think added a real life, everyday touch to the story. There isnt a cliff-hanger per say but you are definitely left with questions that can only be answered in the second book. A must read for YANA Paranormal fans.

Getting to see cameos from Daemon, Archer, and some other characters from the Lux series was a real treat. I loved that we really got to know Luc more and see how hes changed and hardened after the war. I loved seeing his relationship with Evie develop  it was filled with excellent banter and high-class flirting. I really liked Evie as a character as well. Shes resilient and brave, even she shes scared out of her mind. She was an easy character to get behind and support. Some of the dialogue was so incredibly cheesy and cringey that I had to put the book down for a second.

This does not affect my opinion. Scythe almost flew under my radar. I''ve never read anything by Neal Shusterman before and hadn''t heard about this one until all of a sudden those closest to me kept talking about it. Then I went to the Simon  Schuster Canada preview and they built up even more hype for this title for me. I''m always scared going into titles with that much excitement but let me tell you...it blew my expectations OUT OF THE WATER There are so many incredibly powerful questions raised through the plot of Scythe and what I love is that nothing is easily resolved or quick-fixed. It looks at morality, human nature, power, corruption, and the actual feasibility of a Utopian society. We are complex creatures and even when we think we have it all figured out, we probably usually haven''t figured out as much as we think. Scythe doesn''t give you any answers to the burning questions and conundrums of humanity but it definitely makes you think. I was also super invested in the plot and the well-being of all okay almost all the characters. For me, if I''m not sucked into the story within the first couple of chapters then you''ve lost me. I was in from the very start, there was no question. The premise is so interesting and the characters are very compelling. I adore Citra, Rowan, and Scythe Faraday and on the other end of the spectrum straight up despise Scythe Goddard and his flashy posse I love when characters make me feel so intensely. I not only highly recommend this book but would likely do some questionable things to get my hands on book 2 right this second. It''s honestly so good and intense. Just read it, okay?',1637625600000),

Humanity has conquered death but people still need to die to keep the population under control so they have people specially trained for it called Scythes. They kill people and cope with having to do it in their own ways. They have 10 rules, a quota, and take on apprentices when more Scythes are needed. I really fell in love with these characters especially Faraday, Rowan, and Citra. Faraday is so honorable, humble, and really suffers from being a Scythe and taking lives. Rowan is so compassionate and his reason for taking on the apprenticeship made so much sense to me. Citra I didnt like in the beginning but slowly came to love her character. She has such amazing character growth as does Rowan. This book had tons of twists and turns and OMG moments. I mean just when I got my bearings BAM a new twist. I love how this story is written each chapter starts with a journal entry from a Scythe journal. It builds the world quickly and there are no big information dumps in the story because of this. The story and writing really draw you in and I couldnt put this book down and read it in 2 days. This book really makes you think about humanity. This book is one of the reasons I love dystopian books the worlds are just close enough to ours that you start thinking about what if our world had somehow gone this way. I highly recommend this book if you love dystopian, books that make you think, and OMG that did not just happen moments. Rating 5 stars',1610496000000),

The main character is a bit dull, but he''s backed up by a cast of intriguing secondary characters, including his sidekick, who I felt was far more interesting, had more to lose, and would have all around made a better main character. The story was interesting, but it doesn''t really pick up or take off until well into the second half of the book. For the first part, the main characters stumble around from one pratfall to the next, always getting out of trouble through sheer luck instead of cunning or skill. As it begins to get old around the middle of the book, the story then really takes off and becomes a page turner. In summary, there are weak characters bolstered by an intriguing world and a compelling story.

Ophelia, a museum curator on the Anima ark, one of the lands created after God smashed the world to bits, is betrothed to Thorn, Treasurer on the Pole ark. Against her will and desire, she must navigate the conniving, gossipy, cutthroat Pole society without losing all sense of independence. Billed as a young adult novel the first Europa has published, the book explores the wiles of the adult world. Clumsy but crafty Ophelia, who can read objects with her hands and travel through mirrors, models a path toward maturity and steadfastness amidst people she can barely trust. The novel excels at intricate plot twists and magical inventions that entertain as well as teach. Enlisting characters from all demographics, from servants to immortal family spirits, and everyone in between, the story twists and turns without veering from the focus on Ophelias coming of age. Ingenius compass roses, mirrors that transport and hourglasses that offer temporary escape enable a glimpse into all corners of a vast, palatial setting. Cunning dialogue between characters is both deceiving as well as illuminating about Ophelias challenges to understand the community shes up against.

Here, the world is literally divided into fragments of the Earth floating around in space by some trick of magic presumably that is messing with the laws of phsyics, each ruled by a family spirit, AKA gods, and each having their own form of governance. The main storyline is about Ophelia, who comes from Anima, Artemis Ark, where the latters descendants have psychometric powers, and the land is sort of a socialist community, being handed over as a diplomatic tribute in marriage to Pole, ruled in a monarchy by Lord Farouk, a hedonistic man-child god who pretty much leaves the ruling of his Ark to his Treasurer, and her fiance, Thorn. The main struggle of the character is to adjust to this new world, to establish her place in it, to not get used as a pawn in the games between the nobles, while in hiding. I think discussing Ophelias character is an important part of how this plot progresses. She is a quiet, reserved woman who doesnt think much of herself but doesnt let anyone walk over her she may come across as passive but I think it is cunning. Her journey through the book is to stand up for herself, to hold on to her sense of self in the face of cruelty, and to realize the power in her strength. Her being skeptical and wary of the Pole from the start, as well as decidedly not trusting Thorn and his aunt, Berenilde even though they are her only allies, is a smart strategy on her part. Opposed to her aunt and chaperone, Rosaline, she quietly observes and gathers information and makes calculated decisions that doesnt mean she doesnt make mistakes or doesnt act in haste, but she usually looks for the best option under the circumstances. The world of Pole is ruthless, and as she gets into the Citaceleste in disguise as Berenildes valet, she sees the nature of the society, which I feel armed her with enough knowledge before the story into the next book. Additionally, and while I dont know if this has been confirmed as canon, Ophelias characterization was very much coded as aro-ace. It could be that the vocabulary of ace-spec wasnt used, but there are other novels that dont explicitly say ace The Ladys Guide to Petticoats and Piracy is a good example but still provide plenty of evidence for it. Ophelia says on multiple occasions that she has never felt anything for Thorn, nor would she ever, and if you are expecting a romance, you will be disappointed. Honestly, the world is too cruel to warp even romantic love, as in the case of Berenilde Thorn does look like he will be the broody-but-a-hidden-soft-side kind of love interest, but theres are many ways the book subverts that. The book has some interesting secondary characters, and their relationships to Ophelia enrich the plot and decide her path forward. The magic system in the book isnt unusual, but it is pretty interesting. I would love to know why Artemis ark has only one kind of power, while Farouks had at least 5. Add to that, there was another ark called LandmArk that had the power to manipulate space. The amalgamation of the powers into the construction of Citaceleste was clever and showed forethought into the world-building. The plot is tight, and usually doesnt leave room for much questions or doubts  if there were any in the start, they were usually resolved later on it is not wholly unpredictable, but hits the sweet spot between keeping you interested by dangling clues but also not making you do all the work. There is still the mystery of the Books which seems like it is going to be a Big Thing later on, so Im excited for what that might reveal. Overall, a magical but not whimsical introduction to the world of the Arks, and a clever heroine to root for',1632182400000),

Loved it so much that I told everyone I know to read it and it is one of my favourite books of the last few years. So going into Thunderhead I had big expectations. The problems with expectations is that they are often not realistic or even sensible. Plot There is quite a bit of political posturing and plot in Thunderhead. Much like in Scythe the internal politics of the Scythdom continue to spiral out of control. There was a point just past halfway where I got bored. It was a lull and normally I''d have just powered through that lull. Instead, because I''m so behind in reading other books I actually read a couple books instead of powering through Thunderhead. That was probably a mistake in terms of continuity. However, once I got back into it a week or two later I found that only a couple pages ahead of where I had stopped was a massive plot twist in which the story just cascades down from. So if you hit a small glitch in your excitement with Thunderhead just keep going because it doesn''t last long. The Thunderhead Almost all of the snippets or journal entries at the beginning of the chapters are the internal thought of the Thunderhead. As an AI that ''runs'' the whole world I expected the Thunderhead to be very practical and have no emotional responses at all. Except that it does. Neal Shusterman has taken the idea of an AI made from human construct and really challenged how it would be. The idea here is that it would be flawed because it was created by humans. And that it can be ''tricked'' by the humans who set-up the server connections... This was a hard thing for me to really accept until near the end of the book when events really allowed me to see not just be told what that might look like. Shusterman is brilliant at making readers eat up his logic by showing them a scenario in which his logic works. Characters I don''t want say a lot here for fear of spoiling something. But let''s just say all the characters we''ve come to know, love and hate in Scythe are back in Thunderhead in some way shape or form. Much of the story is told from Scythe Anastasia''s Citra''s point of view. Cliffhangers Yep, you guessed it. Just like Scythe, Thunderhead ends with a major cliffhanger. This kills me as I am now dying to read the next book not out yet at time of this writing and makes it hard to get into new books for me sometimes. I get why it''s done this way. Marketing hype is a hard thing to generate if people aren''t dying to know what happens next. But sometimes I wish for the ''sort of ending'' that we always got with Harry Potter or Narnia. Just sayin''. Overall Definitely this deserves a spot on my print bookshelf and this series continues to be one of the best in the last couple years, in my opinion. I love how sophisticated it is while still being a teen novel. I wish there had been books like this when I was a teen I think this shows how much we have changed as humans in just the last 20 years. We are able to be a little more critical of society and we''ve certainly learned a lot good and bad about social media and mob mentality. Thunderhead does a good job of taking the society we know now and making his ScytheThunderhead future relatable. Please note I received an eARC of this book from the publisher via NetGalley.

I dont feel like I really know Kenji any better. I dont feel like this novella was necessary. I guess the only reason I would consider this novella worth the read is for the very end just to get a bit of how Juliette disappeared, from Kenjis point of view. The rest of the novella I could honestly have been fine without. Oh, and the price of this novella is absolutely ridiculous 4.99? For a mid-series novella?? Seriously???

It made it read more like women''s fiction than romance. There was one event toward the end of the story that I won''t spoil for anyone else that is what ultimately made me drop the star. It felt like gratuitous heartbreak. It didn''t, for me, add anything to this story other than let''s punch the reader in the gut. Other than that one thing, I loved this book. The letters, the strength, the growth it was all so amazing. I was immediately connected to all of these characters and I wanted everything to work out for them.

Being one that does not cry or get too emotionally while reading, my blogger friends were waiting to see if I was in fact human and not a robot. I am proud to report that I am human. There was so many raw moments throughout the story and you get a massive punch that will utterly gut you. The beautiful thing about The Last Letter is you get more than just a romance story. You get a real life feel to the trials and tribulations that Elle goes through. I could not fathom the strength that Elle has. She is a warrior momma. She is a fighter. But then you have Beckett. Fulfilling the wish of his best friend, how he just wedges himself so seamlessly into Elles life that he lifts such a burden off of her shoulders. I absolutely adored their connection as well. It is more than physical, but also on that emotional level as well. They mend each other in so many ways. As a whole, this is one of the most absolutely stunning books I have read in my whole life. It gives you everything and so much more. Finding love when you least expect it, the twists that get tossed at Elle, the fierce love and protectiveness that Beckett has over Elle and her twins. There is love, life, laughter, self discovery and everything wrapped up in this heartbreaking yet so full of hope and living life to the fullest I have adored Yarross words for years but this book is just absolutely everything. Please pick this book up, you may hate me and love me at the same time for this one',1618531200000),

Each of the Bennett siblings provides a fabulous romance while we get to know the whole family. 4  Your Inescapable Love Oh those matchmaking Bennetts are at it again. Emilia and Max were those 2 kids that met and an instant friendship was formed, they were 9. That initial first meeting melted my heart. When Emilia moved away, they lost touch. Jump ahead 15 years and Max needs physical therapy, imagine his surprise when Emilia is his therapist. There is such an amazing comfort and connection between these two, can they keep a professional relationship during Maxs therapy? This is almost a second chance romance yet when they were kids, they were best friends, love wasnt discussed. Emilia is a fabulous character, always working to be strong to face the challenges placed in front of her, losing her parents and now struggling to help Grams with her illness. She hates to show weakness but she has insecurities. Max is that cocky sexy man that didnt see long-term relationship in his life. I loved experiencing his revelations about Emilia. These two show you that puppy love can be real love. All the while we get to spend more time with the entire Bennett clan. I am loving this series and all the fun, sexy romances the Bennett clan deliver. 5  Your Tempting Love Im a huge fan of the Bennett Family series. Its Christophers turn to get Bennettitis as Pippin and Alice plot his downfall into romance. He is buying a new place so his sisters recommend Victoria to decorate for him. They see a perfect match between the two. Christopher had his heart broken by a woman so he doesnt want a relationship. Of course, he never expected feisty, confident Victoria to bump into his life. Victoria is surprised by Christopher and his thoughtfulness to her sister. She is now the guardian to her three siblings and has started her own business making her life stressful as she tries to balance everything. She is always worried that what she is doing is the best thing for the kids. As Victoria tries to keep her relationship with Christopher professional, Christopher keeps finding ways to slide into her personal life. There is a wonderful blending of their lives as these two given in to their attraction. Of course, life throws them a few curve balls along the way. Love their chemistry, banter and flirting. The kids are wonderful and Chloe steals the show more than once 6  Your Alluring Love Reading more about the Bennett family always makes me smile. This is a great clan that bands together to help each other while allowing each other to fly and find their own path. This time, we get Alices story, she has been a significant part of the matchmaking plans for the family. I was excited for her to find her HEA. She has been in love with Nate, her brothers best friend, for years but because hes friends with her brother, and older, hes been off limits. She has pined for him from a far. Nate is in love with Alice but out of respect for his friend, has stayed away. His TV career has had him all over the globe working so when he finally ends up back in San Francisco on a long-term project, well, he decides to take chance and asks Alice out. I love how these two tried so hard to stay away even when their electric attraction kept pulling them together. Nate is very persistent but Alice is clever and makes his job hard. All of these stories deliver fun, romance, passion and overall, a great sense of family, whether blood related or not. Im always excited to dive in and learn more about the Bennett family members lives.',1596844800000),

Dates at the beginnings of chapters give a timeline to follow. Georgie Young, an intrepid young correspondent from London, accepts an assignment to Berlin. As soon as she arrives she senses an almost eerie state of calm and order in the streets, red flags flapping in the breeze. But the calm exterior is a front for something far more sinister and evil as she quickly discovers. Filled with compassion she wants to help Jewish people but is told to not get involved. Max Spender, another correspondent from London with more international experience, is quick to see through Hitler propaganda as well. He and Georgie pair up to seek truths but it''s difficult as not everyone is who and what they seem. Personal missions grow well beyond reporting. Berlin is the epicenter of excitement, both good Cosmopolitan and bad, mostly the latter. The Jews are treated deplorably and Georgie and Max are desperate to help. As British foreigners they are better tolerated at first so they use that to their advantage. Along the way they form deep friendships with others. Meanwhile, Georgie continues to write her column on the human side of the war for the newspaper in England to create awareness. So much to love here...it''s so easy to become lost in and impossible to put down I walked around the house with it glued to my hand. Characters and events are believable and have depth. The subplots are equally fascinating, twisting and turning to the very last page. The newspaper articles are brilliant If I had to sum this book up in five words they would be heartbreaking, enchanting, bittersweet, lovely and riveting. I wanted to laugh with them and cry with them. A very easy 55 for me.

However, he never expected this His father''s goddaughter, Georgiana Georgie Bridgerton, has been ruined, and his father wants him to ...wait for it...marry her Their families have been friends and neighbors for years, and they are also connected by marriage. Nicholas is stunned and furious. Georgie''s not too thrilled with the situation, either. They''ve been friends as long as they remember, but marriage? They decide to take a chance - friendship is more than a lot of married couples have together. Can it turn into more? Georgie and Nicholas were both totally enchanting characters. They are now one of my favorite romance couples. The thing I found so beautiful was their ability to make each other laugh until they cried. After all, it''s one of the reasons I married my own hero Georgie was fascinated by Nicholas'' studies and doctoring , and she wanted to be involved in it. Nicholas realized just how beautiful and special he found Georgie. Friendship is a beautiful thing, isn''t it? The supporting characters were also a delight. Anthony and Benedict, Georgie''s nephews, were adorable little hellions. The families'' butlers Wheelock and Thamesly were priceless. However, my favorite supporting character may very well be Cat-Head, the demon cat from hell. Just picturing Cat-Head in his carriage hammock brings a smile to my face.. This is definitely a witty and romantic read you don''t want to miss I received an ARC of this book courtesy of the publisher and Edelweiss.

First Comes Scandal by Julia Quinn is a Bridgerton Prequel, the fourth book in the Rokesbys series. It could be read as a standalone, but Ive read and enjoyed the other books in this series, so do recommend reading them all. Nicholas Rokesby is at medical school in Edinburgh when he is summoned home by his father. The reason for the urgent summons is that a fortune-hunting suitor kidnapped close family friend Georgiana Bridgerton, and even though she managed to escape, her reputation has been ruined, and his father would like him to marry Georgiana to preserve her reputation as she has refused to marry the scoundrel. Nicholas is astounded by the suggestion. He had no plans to marry is in the middle of exams at medical school, and Georgiana is like a sister to him, isnt she? Georgiana at first turns him down because she doesnt want to spend the rest of her life feeling grateful, but as they spend time together, they begin to think that perhaps its not such a ridiculous idea. This is a delightful friends to lovers, not so convenient marriage of convenience story, and I enjoyed it immensely. Medium Steam.

Julia Quinn, Bridgertons. Must I say more? If you have read any of Julia''s books and especially the Bridgerton series, you know they steal the hearts of all who are addicted to historical romance. Yes, raising both hands and happy to say so. Ms Quinn has an amazing gift of bring smiles, laugh out loud moments, serious angst, sometimes suspense, but always a story well told. Georgie Bridgerton ends up in a no win situation. Abducted for her dowry, she is ruined in the eyes of the Ton. Either marry the rogue or live her life alone. Not a great choice? But she is saved, or could it just be pulled out of the lesser of evils by the proposal of Nicolas Rokesby, who she has known as the boy next door. Could this be an unexpected match to happiness? Nicholas had only ever thought of her as a friend, but sometimes the least expected might be what fate had in mind',1580601600000),

Nora, Christina and Leanne have only one thing in common their friend Molly. They each share an independent friendship with her, happy in their belief that individually, they are Mollys best friend as they ignore the reality of the others'' roles, despite sharing a joint history going back to their early childhood. Now in their early 30s, Molly has died, leaving the three women bereft and alone with their grief. Mischief-maker Molly makes it her last wish that the ladies do brunch together once a month for one year. The former childhood friends all approach the Sunday brunches with equal amounts of dread, although we never come to understand why these three ladies all despise each other. Molly''s plans for her three friends also involve strange gifts that the women puzzle the meaning of. As the three women agree to make it work even though their hearts arent really into the task, what follows is the slow unravelling of past and current events that draw each of the women into different journeys of self-discovery. Full marks must go to Suzanne Nugent for making this novel an immensely fun, and times downright hysterical read when it could have been a rather sombre affair. This story is beautifully paced, with humour in almost every scene, though there is also a good deal of tenderness in the mix. Never the main character, the author has cleverly made Molly indispensable in many scenes. The three women are ably created, keen, honest and flawed and I found that I could relate to them all on some level which was definitely the icing on the cake. Powerful, incredibly amusing, poignant, sharp and uplifting, Brunch and Other Obligations is a real jewel and is well worth reading. I for one, will be watching out for Suzanne Nugent''s next offering. I received a complimentary copy of this novel at my request from She Writes Press via NetGalley and this review is my unbiased opinion.',1621209600000),

I found it easy to read with Danielle Steels trademark writing style. I have been reading this authors novels since I was twelve I borrowed them from my mother and then the library. Despite the subject matter, it is an easy breezy type of book. A husband has an affair, and we see how it affects his wife and children. The situation is further complicated because the mistress is an actress, and he is a bestselling novelist. The point-of-view switches between Nadia, Nicolas, and Rose. We get to see each persons point-of-view on the affair and how it affects them. We go from Paris to LA and to New York as well as the French countryside. The author provides good descriptions of each character which allowed me to visualize them. I liked seeing Nadia develop into a stronger more confident woman. We also get to the see the four sisters strengthen their bond. This story did not play out as I expected which was great. I like that the women are smart and driven. It is wonderful that the author gave us strong female characters. There is plenty of glamour as well in the story it would not be a Danielle Steel novel without a little glitz. There is some mild foul language in the book plus a repetition of information. I do not need a characters backstory repeated to me several times nor the details of the affair. The Affair was a wonderfully distracting novel. I enjoy books that takes your mind of your own worries. The Affair is a poignant novel with a frustrating affair, sensitive sisters, a compassionate mother, a self-absorbed thespian, a sinister secret, a problematic pregnancy, and a reckless spouse.',1599609600000),

The love story of Puck the Satyr-like keeper of the demon Indifference and Gillian Shaw the girl William the Dark, adopted son of Hades rescued and who most fans thought would end up with, so readers get a love triangle too. The authors putting Puck and Gillian together is understandably upsetting for some fans but give them a chance because they ROCK as a couple and watching Gillian mature from a frightened former abused tragic figure to a fierce, take-no-prisoners warrior woman is fantastic and there is no Lord more honorable than Puck plus their story is amazing so give them a chance to grow on you. The storyline closely follows the previous installment in the series but long time fans can skip around a bit without losing too much information, but newbies need to start from book one. Its unexpected and un-put-downable and if readers will give them a chance theyll see they really are the perfect match. Besides author bashing is not cool SUMMARY Puck the keeper of the demon Indifference needs a wife, to fulfill a prophecy to regain the throne of Amaranthia and overthrow his brother who centuries ago betrayed him and forced him to a hellish eternity. Not any bride will do, he must have the womangirl belonging to William the Dark but she must come to him willingly. Hell need to learn to taper his surprisingly intense desire for her or shell bolt before the prophecy is fulfilled. Gillian Shaw was ready to celebrate her eighteenth birthday by seducing the immortal man who saved her from her abusive stepfather and stepbrothers, the man she loves with all her heart but still finds intimacy torturous. Instead she finds herself tossed down the rabbit hole with a half man half beast immortal demon-keeper who claims her for his wife. Strangely enough shes not afraid of him, but theres definitely others out there that she should fear.',1634860800000),

Most of the book took place in the Night Court, which couldn''t have been more gorgeously described. The new characters were utterly fantastic, distinguishable, and loveable with rich histories and pasts. And Rhys... Oh man, where do I begin with him? He took on a completely different side, and it wasn''t long before I completely fell in love with him. Such a powerful character with a dark history and a strength I can''t even begin to describe. Definitely one of the best fantasy princes ever written. Every character was layered and complex, but Feyre was of course the star. Her journey was incredible, harrowing, and emotional. I loved that she remained realistic 910 times. She overcame her truly awful struggles with and without the help of new allies, and became a force to be reckoned with. A stellar heroine who I have nothing but admiration and respect for. The action scenes were vivid, the monsters and their horrors absolutely devious, and the romance deliciously passionate and steamy.

She''s 27. She decides to have a baby with a sperm donor before the choice is taken away from her. The only problem is that her best friend since they were seven years old, Drew Flannery, wants to be the sperm donor and he wants to do it the old-fashioned way. Can the friendship withstand the whirlwind affair they''re about to embark on for the sake of getting her pregnant? Fabulous story These two friends have an amazing relationship. I found myself smiling constantly and sometimes laughing out loud at their crazy antics. Watching Avery sister try to be happy for her was heart-wrenching. Avery''s grandparents are cruel and unfeeling. All they care about is extending the Yeung line and the proper role of a wife. It''s a good thing her father supports her in whatever makes her happy. I love how this author can touch on the tragedy of cancer and at the same time show us the loving, sexy and very humorous relationship between the characters in this story, without lessening the impact of the disease.

As satisfyingly romantic as it was to witness the triumph of Penelopes underdog and the lead into the escape of Eloises Regency feminist from the limits her own sense of common sense and justice have placed upon her ability to seek happiness in traditional ways, Quinns talent for capturing comic moments continues to shine through in this instalment of the Bridgerton series. The Netflix writers who adapt who adapt Colin and Penelopes story for the screen can literally just take a page from the book when it comes to injecting comedy into Season 4 For this reader, two scenes in particular showcase the comic impulses of the author. Predictably, the scene in which Colin reveals to Portia Featherington his desire to wed her third daughter - yes Penelope - is classic. Even funnier is the timing of the scene in the epilogue when Colin, Eloise, Hyacinth and Penelope are badgering each other prior to Penelopes anticlimactic attempt to own up to her alter egos identity and achievements, only to discover her dramatic revelation had already been relayed by the Hyacinth, despite bribes to the contrary As Daphnes reflection upon her impulse to default to childish behaviour reveals, sibling relationships can yield humorous punctuation to the plot. As much as extinguishing Whistledowns voice is a loss and could signal resolution of a mystery that has propelled the Bridgerton series forward, the information that this story reveals about other, yet unmarried, Bridgerton siblings, provides inducement to keep reading the series, even without the narrator and her power. This reader cannot wait to find out about the secret life of Eloise, and what she has really been up to behind the scenes. And while Hyacinths function as a foil in the family has been minimal, there are also glimpses of how the author may differentiate the grown Hyacinths character into a future protagonist with a multi-dimensional role.',1580601600000),

I would like to have seen the former explored. This would have supported both characters struggles. At times I think the book should be more subtle about the demarcation between the light and heavy. They literally go from a romantic drive-in to a death-cult camp. Overall, though the book is a breath of fresh air from your usual girl meets boy, hates boy, falls madly in love with said boy. It holds the attention and has potential for development of other characters in the book. I would recommend this and read other tiles by Emily Henry.',1618531200000),

Shes had a lot of success in her first novels, but is now battling writers block. Shes also faced a lot of change in her life recently, including the death of her father and the breakup of a long-term relationshipFurthermore, she learns of her fathers secret life with another woman in another town - North Bear Shores. In fact, he leaves his cottage in North Bear Shores to January in his estate. Confused, broke, grieving and with a looming literary deadline, January leaves her home for the summer in hopes of writing her next novel, and cleaning out the cottage so that she can sell it. On her first evening at the cottage she is re-introduced to her next door neighbour, Augustus Gus Everett, whom she recognizes from her college days. Gus is an author of literary fiction and is in the process of getting a divorce. Like January, he is also broke and battling writers block. The two agree to try something new - January will write a book within the literary fiction genre and Gus will attempt to write romance. While one can surmise that a romance between the two will develop, this book is about so much more. Through a series of field trips intended to guide the other in their writing, the couple learn more about each other and about themselves in the process. Each carries some significant baggage that needs to be addressed in order for the couple to begin healing individually, and to come together. The book kept me engaged throughout. I felt connected to the characters and sensitive to their pain and insecurities. It reinforces my belief that its important not to judge others until you have heard, and understand, their story. I highly recommend this book to those that enjoy either contemporary romance or general fiction.

He''s a player in more ways then one - evidenced by the fact that he''s engaging in a threesome at the start of this story, a man with a reputation for sure, and the last person with whom straight laced and serious Allie would ever think of getting involved. But, on the rebound from the end of a long term relationship her decision, she falls into his bed after all. A one time thing, just to acknowledge the crazy attraction between them and move on. Only, one time turns into two times turns into more - and suddenly their sex only fling under wraps is becoming a lot more serious. Can it survive exposure to real life? I enjoyed this story. I liked both the characters, and despite Dean''s reputation, underneath all that is just a guy who''s scared of commitment. When he''s with Allie you get a sense of his real self, a sweet and really nice guy under the veneer of the devil may care attitude he sports. He''s in a bit of a tough spot at the moment trying to figure out his future, dealing with an old nemesis the father of an ex girlfriend who happens to be his new coach, and discovering that spending time with a group of young wannabee hockey players is actually something he enjoys. Top that off with some hot sex with Allie and things are pretty intense. Personally I wasn''t a big fan of the casual drug use in the story - maybe that makes me old fashioned but with all the emphasis on drug free sport these days, I thought it could have been left out though it does have some later implications in the plot. Allie herself was very likeable, a smart, head on her shoulders kind of gal, who is swept off her feet by the hot sex with Dean but smart enough to know that it''s not going to mean anything unless his attitude changes. The lighthearted and fun moments give way to a much more serious tone in the second half though. I felt a bit blindsided by this as I''m betting all readers will, and there were almost some ugly crying moments. To turn that around into a happy ending took some effort but I thought it was well handled. Overall an enjoyable read but keep some tissues handy.

I was so excited to get the conclusion to Feyre and Rhys''s story. There was the right amount of humor, angst, anxiety, and heat. I LOVE their bond and connection le sigh I enjoyed the drama, the sneakiness, and ultimately the conclusion but at times felt like I wanted more or less of things. Let me explain... There was a lot of introductions to new characters in this one and some times I found it hard to keep them all together, trying to remember who was who. I guess the reason for this is to have some of these characters have their own books later which is something I would definitely read but at times I also felt that there was back story that I was missing and wanted to know more about. There would have been some conclusions that I would have loved to get in this book but this already being a 700 page book I could see how that would make a long book even longer. Speaking of long book... there were times that I was kind of bored. And I hate saying that as I love this series but some things were almost too detailed, too explained and I just wanted to move on to get to the action or to maybe get some of the backstory that I felt was missing. I wanted more of the battle and fight, to get more action so I could feel the heart palpitations of who was going to make it and survivethat gut wrenchingominous feeling in my heart was missing. Yes, there was the big fight in the end, but I guess I would have thought that there would be more spread out throughout the book. Did I feel some emotion and heartachemost definitely but I just wanted more. I wish I saw more of the power of some of the characters. But again, maybe this will come out more in the future books? I hope so I continue to love the world buildingSarah knows how to create beautiful worlds and I was there, I could see it in my mind. I loved the friendship of these charactersgoing above and beyond for each other and doing anything to protect each other made me love them even more. That friendship of this circle is probably one of the best things about this series and one of the strongest ones I have seen in any series for that matter. The great joy and honor of my life has been to know you. To call you my family. And I am grateful - more than I can possibly say - that I was given this time with you all. I can''t wait to see what she has in store for us in 2018 and whose story is next I want to add that this took longer for me to read than the previous books... Again I enjoyed it but I would have liked it EVEN MORE if was a bit more faster paced. Oh and to add one more thing - I really WISH they would stop marketing this series as a YA because I would NEVER allow my teens to read this book with some of the graphic things that happen. If this is meant to be YA then some of those scenes should definitely not be included.',1583193600000),

Here, Jacob and Sallie''s connection is white-hot and goes well beyond just their physical chemistry. Jacob is everything a gal could want in a possessive, protective, dominant lover, and he''s not going to let anything stand in their way. The HEA was solid, if a bit abrupt.

Now, ten years later he suddenly shows up in her life at a convention along with her ex-boss, who is dating her ex-boyfriend and her Salena Auntie who has a guy she brought along as possible husband material. So what does Liam do?

I''m not someone who usually pays much attention to them, because I''m always eager to get into what''s between the covers, but that doesn''t mean I can''t take a moment or ten to appreciate one. Now that that''s done, I can tell you all about how much this book amazed me and entertained me. I haven''t read many books by Elle Kennedy, but I''m beginning to realize how talented a story teller she is. She somehow manages to take a guy who messes up with a great girl and turns it into a journey of self discovery and growth for the both of them. I was hoping for something funny and hot, but instead found a story that is mentally, physically, and emotionally engaging while also being impossible to put down. I loved that the story was told from dual points of view. It was great being inside John Logan Logan''s head and in Grace Iver''s too. There were no guessing games about what they were thinking about or about how the felt about each other. However the real fun for them began when they tried to figure out the mess their relationship had become. I was totally surprised by how easy things felt between Logan and Grace, especially with them being on opposite sides of the social hierarchy at Briar University and polar opposites when it came to personalities, but it turns out none of that mattered at all. It''s hard to pin point what it was about this book I enjoyed the most. It''s a three way tie between the chemistry, dialogue, and issues Logan and Grace faced. Logan and Grace had wonderful chemistry. While things may not have started out slowly between them, I really enjoyed seeing the relationship between them develop. I felt like it was a slow burn, because they both had to work to overcome choices the other had made. I also love how much I laughed while I read this book. Both Grace and Logan were extremely witty in their repartee with one another and in their own inner monologues and thoughts. I thought it was adorable seeing Grace babble, but that''s because I have that particular habit as well. College is a time to try new things, but as Grace finds, somethings don''t change. I empathized with her for the situation she found herself dealing with concerning a trusted friend. I also understood her pain when Logan made the mistake that changed both of them. I also understood Logan''s pain, confusion, and torn feelings about Hannah and Grace. I even understood his desire and fear when he looked to his future and didn''t like what he saw. I will say this though, even though Grace and Logan were each facing so many challenges and changes, I loved how resolute they were in facing them. When Grace needed support, Logan was there and vice versa. This series has quickly become one of my favorites. I loved seeing Garrett and Hannah again. I loved being surprised by Logan and Grace''s interactions with one another. Seeing all four of the roommates interact and support one another, was also satisfying to read about.

Logan is not looking for anyone special, until he figures out that he was not lusting after his best friend''s girl - just their relationship.

Grace is an excellent student who is just trying to survive her Freshman year in college. Her father is a professor, so he pressures her to stay away from the fun and the parties. Grace''s mom is the opposite and wants her to have too much fun. Now what? Logan and Grace keep running into one another. Parties, movies, and the dorm. Logan cannot keep away from her now that he knows she brings him peace. Just being with her settles him mind and all the chaotic thoughts about his empty future.

It was long, but the writing was so good that at the end, I honestly didn''t believe I was at the end. I seriously thought there was more. That there had to be more. Don''t get me wrong, it didn''t end on a cliffhanger or anything, but the characters live such dramatic and interesting lives that the end of a 650 page book was not enough for me. Anyway, I can definitely say with certainty that I am so happy to have read this book I''d also like to thank the author for writing this book with such relatable characters, modern setting, and just touching on such relevant content. There were such intricate details that pass you by and they don''t affect the bigger picture of the story, but they give the story a much deeper and enhanced flavor at the end. Regardless of how you feel about Jessie and Johnny, their parenting is actually quite good. I don''t care much for the way Johnny regards his children or his step-children, but Jessie deals with her kids quite well, especially TJ who is non-binary and wants hairstyles and clothes and her name to reflect that and Jessie and Johnny do everything they can to support her wishes. The speech that Ferdia made with Perla was so important, so woke, so necessary, and just so amazing. Honestly, as much as these characters annoyed me, they also grew and learned and got better and did better for themselves and for others and in the end, the bow wasn''t tied all nice and pretty, their lives will keep going because that''s what happens in reality. All we got to see was a snapshot of their lives, the before and the after, and we got to see them change over time. It wasn''t all happy endings, but it was satisfying in a wistful way. Like you can imagine a better ending or continuation for the characters and nothing is closed off. To end this review of this awesome book I''d just like to say, I''m so happy I got to read this, I know it will be very very popular I''m sure, and if there was a show or movie made on it, I might not even be able to watch because of second-hand embarrassment, but I hope it does get made into something in order for more people to know these characters and their crazy stories and fall in love with the family much like I have Thank you to the publishers Penguin Random House Canada, and the author Marian Keyes, for my free copy of this book in exchange of an honest review.',1583193600000),

It was hard for me to understand why Samson was so attracted to her she seemed very distant and cold throughout the book. I get why she acts like that, but the way she kept treating him, it was hard to justify his perseverance in pursuing her. I wish the author showed the other sides of her that the other characters seem to see, but we dont. It was unfortunately hard for me to sympathize with her. On the other hand, Samson was a bit too good to be true and felt like the polar opposite of Rhiannon. Even though I wish men like him really did exist, it didnt feel real.

Mutual dislike soon becomes reluctant tolerance, then a friends with benefits arrangement. Neither will admit that love is involved, or that they want something more than a temporary fling. Handsome Sawyer Dalton is a world travelling investigative journalist with the soul of a cowboy. He is part owner of the Dry Creek Ranch with his two cousins and his journalism career helps offset the cost of running the ranch, but the ranch and his family are his heart and soul. Returning from a journalistic conference, he is surprised to find a client of his parents PR firm ensconced in his apartment on the ranch. His first meeting with Gina DeRose, a disgraced celebrity chef hiding from the media, is full of snark and dislike on both sides. He quickly transfers the unwanted guest to a small neglected cabin on the ranch and heads back to his apartment to sleep. The next few encounters see a tolerance and a budding friendship form. Sawyer is annoyed she keeps invading his kitchen, but doesnt complain too much because he benefits from her great cooking. When he finally gets Ginas version of the scandal that has her hiding out on the family ranch, Sawyer goes into investigator mode and does a little digging. He wants to help her clear her name if he can, but realizes he also will be helping her to go back to her celebrity life, a life that wont include him...or will it? His first impression of Gina was that of a neurotic, narcissistic and spoiled celebrity who deserved what she got in terms of bad press. Now he knows she is woman driven to succeed, but insecure about her talent. She is also stubborn, compassionate and more vulnerable than she allows other people to see. Gina disliked the rude cowboyjournalist at first, but his gruffness grows on her, as do his compliments about her cooking. She badly needs the praise to bolster her self esteem. His passionate kisses and their make out sessions leave her breathless and purring. But a relationship with the handsome cowboy cant really go anywhere, can it? The twists and turns of this story are captivating as is the slow burn romance between Sawyer and Gina. They work together to find out who is behind the hatchet job on her reputation and up falling in love. Neither was looking for love, but love found them anyway. This is a great read for all lovers of romance with a fascinating storyline. I received an ARC of this book via NetGalley and I am voluntarily leaving an honest review.',1637625600000),

The playful banter and barbs from James and Violet were my favorite and I was rooting for these two to figure out their issues from the very start. I think the drama and misunderstandings were drawn out a bit too much though and I have a hard time believing that this miscommunication lasted 4 years. The characters were pretty immature for people in their 20''s, but given their histories and insecurities, it was somewhat understandable. They did grow and start to take responsibility for their actions, but by that point the drama felt over the top and drama just for drama''s sake. The secondary characters were a lot of fun and I''m definitely intrigued and hopeful that we will see stories for Diana, Jeremy, Emily, Julian, West, and Sophie. Overall, an entertaining read and I look forward to reading more by Martha Waters in the future. I voluntarily read an advance review copy of this book',1618531200000),

I enjoyed both Violet and James. Their relationship started off with a bang and then fast forward five years and we learn that it also ended with one as well. With a beginning that was hot and steamy, filled with so much passion in and out of the bedroom, this couple now find themselves living in a cold place with very little interaction between them. When an event occurs that sets Violet down the path of wifely fury, the past four years show to be very pale indeed. Hed meant to needle her, annoy her, but always maintain the upper ground  and yet, when she was looking at him like that, really looking at him without any of the distance that had spread between them, it was all he could do to keep his hands at his sides, to resist the temptation to reach out, pull her to him, and kiss her senseless. Violet was the opposite of what society dictated. Shes forthright and outspoken and while she doesnt scandalize society, if they could see the real her, she would surely be ostracized. James has seen the real her and he loved everything about her. The fact that he wanted no other woman made me love him. Before he had met Violet, he would have said that he enjoyed kissing, that it was a diverting stop on the road to greater pleasures. But with violet, kissing was not merely a stop along a well-trodden path. It was a destination all its own. This is filled with plenty of fun arguing and banter as well as other characters that added humor to the already ridiculous situation this couple had worked themselves into. The steam level is low and this is a very slow burn until James and Violet finally give in to their desires and then, holy heck, they proved this wasnt my mommas historical romance. While Im not an expert on what is true or not during the era this was written for, I found it to be very realistic. With plenty of descriptions and the inner thoughts of this hero and heroine, I found myself swept up into their time and place. Overall, this was a very enjoyable read and while I did skim a bit of descriptions and inner-logue towards the end, and would have loved to have received an epilogue, I was quite satisfied at the end.',1634860800000),

To Have and to Hoax by Martha Waters is her debut book. Lady Violet Gray and Lord James Audley met on a moonlit terrace, and less than 20 minutes later, she was declared compromised, and he did the honourable thing, and they married. Their marriage worked delightfully for the first year because they were very attracted to each other, but when they found out that theyd been set up James not one to trust people decided that Violet must have been in on it and so theyve spent the last four years estranged and not speaking. When Violet is notified that James has been injured, she rushes to his side broken-hearted that perhaps she waited too long to let him know she still loved him, only to find that hes fine and wondering why she would bother. Violet decides to make James understand how she felt by pretending to be ill, a plan it is noted her friends thought would inevitably fail, and of course, it does leading to a situation where she knows that he knows that she knows that he knows and much laughter. The story is funny and charming with excellent banter and a Happy Ever After that can only be achieved by letting go of the past, learning to trust and opening your heart. Medium Steam.

It''s so sweet my teeth hurt, lol not that that is a necessarily a bad thing. I was excited to hear that this author was starting a new series and one that combined MC club and mechanics because they work so well together. I enjoyed getting to know new club members and get to see old favorites as well. As this is a spin-off series, we get a lot of time with the Knights of Fury members from precious books. The world building was nice and the individual personalities were fun as well. I enjoyed the romance in this story, though it was way too sweet for my tastes I like a bit of grit and dirt, especially in a MC story. These two were definitely made for each other. There is quite a lot that happens in this story and as such is fast paced. I did think the flow was a bit off starting at the 50 mark, it was repetitive and the main action was wrapped up by 75 but also too much was added at the end that just drew out the story without really adding anything to it. .I also felt that this story was too clean and simple. There also was not much MC about this story other then the very basics had patches, rode motorcycles and had a clubhouse. The emotions, heart, kindness and respect was a major theme throughout this entire story and it leaves me with a nice warm fuzzy feeling. I enjoyed reading this story, it wasn''t my favorite from this author but I am still excited to have read it. I think others looking for safe, wholehearted warm stories will enjoy this one.

I love Chantal Fernando. In fact, shes the author that introduced me to the hot MC world with her Wind Dragons Motorcycle Club books. Lets just say, since then, Ive become a bit obsessed with the MC world. In Fernandos newest release, Custom Built, a spin off from her Knights of Fury MC series, we meet Bronte. Note, Custom Built can be read as a standalone. I havent yet read the Knights books and I didnt feel lost. The book is from Brontes perspective, so when we are missing info, chances are, she is too. But, because there are so many characters from the Knights, I fully intend to go back and read those books next, just to expand my knowledge, and of course, to read about those hot MC boys she writes so well. Bronte is having probably the worst year of her life. Shes having health problems, she just lost her job, and nothing seems to be going her way. She is lucky enough to get an admin job at a custom motorcycle shop. Sure, she knows nothing about motorcycles, but how hard can it be? The job itself is easy enough, but soon she finds herself at odds with Crow, her boss, and a member of the Knights of Fury MC. Crow, who is of course drop dead gorgeous, is also broody and standoffish - but only to Bronte it seems. Shes not sure what she did to get on his bad side, but it definitely rubs her the wrong way. Soon though, when Bronte finds herself in the centre of a murder conspiracy, much to her surprise, Crow is there for her, along with the rest of the Knights MC and the women who love them. I really felt for Bronte and everything she goes through. Shes a strong and determined character. The romance between her and Crow was sweet and sexy. Hes such a great character - swoon-worthy for sure. If I was missing anything, I would say it was not seeing a bit from Crows perspective. I always like to get in the guys head. Unfortunately we only ever see things from Brontes point of view. In fact, she should have probably been on the book cover instead of Crowbut looking at it again, maybe I should stop complaining. This book kept me interested and pulled me in quickly and I look forward to more in the Fury world. Fans of Veronica Mars will like it too since there is the mystery  PI aspect to it.

If I had to pinpoint things that didn''t quite work I''d have to say I wanted to know more about the MC. They aren''t the main focus of the series, but there are so many members mentioned, I really wanted to know more. I suspect this is because I came into this blind and have not read the previous Knights of Fury series.

It''s a story about the love-hate relationship between Lucy Hutton and Joshua Templeton, office mates and personal assistants to co-CEOs of the merged Bexley  Gamin publishing company. From their first meeting, Lucy and Joshua have annoyed, ignored, and pushed the other in a constant dance of one-up-manship. They play little office games guaranteed to irritate i.e., the Mirror Game, the Staring Game, the HR Game, the ultimate goal being to elicit smiles or tears. She wears bright red lipstick, and her wardrobe is full of knits and retro. His is strictly business suits and ties, colored with an array of starched shirts. She''s only five feet tall. He stands over six feet. She takes baked goods to division heads meetings. He scares even the most hardened staff member. And when they become competitors for a newly created position just above their own, they do everything they can to win the sole promotion spot. So what happens when they realize just how much they love their hate relationship? There are so many things I like about this story. First, is the writing style of the author. It''s refreshing and engaging, and though I don''t usually like books written in present tense, it works here. Second, I enjoy the main story and the subplots. They flow together seamlessly and come to a satisfying conclusion. Also, the two main characters have interesting backstories and are developed so well, I feel like I''ve known them forever. And finally, by the end of the story, both Lucy and Josh have grown and changed to the point you know that they''ll have good things in their future. THE HATING GAME is a witty, engaging debut book and one destined for my re-read shelf. The lighthearted story is perfect for a vacation or for a relaxing weekend at home and would be a great addition to your contemporary romance library.

They begin to learn things about each other that might turn the Hating Game into something much different, and much more serious. I love a debut novel because its an introduction to a fresh new voice and its always interesting to see where that new voice might take us as readers. Sally Thorne is a new voice with an extraordinary knack for creating truly fabulous banter between characters. My only real complaint was that there were times when I had trouble discerning which character was saying what. Otherwise, I loved the romantic comedy nature of this story, and Lucy and Josh are perfection albeit at times, a bit corny. The story started out a little slow for me but once we reached the elevator scene, the true nature of the relationship exploded within the pages and had me hooked to the point of choosing to keep reading rather than sleep.

There are two real standalone novels which have more emphasis on the love aspect - Rescuing Emily with adorable and bright six year old Annie and Mr Pink with the similarly aged but more risk-taking Sophie, although the latter book has more physical love alongside the developing emotional love. Rescuing Emily is actually one of a very long list of military related novels by Susan Stoker. I have read everything she has written to date across a number of interrelated series so it was a real pleasure to reread this book, and a pleasant break from the extreme darkness and violence of the the novel that immediately precedes it in this anthology. Incidentally, if you want to follow up on her, Marrying Emily is a later book in the same series with a front cover featuring Annie in a dress The one novel that I had real trouble with was The Bounty - in the description of this novel as a single volume it is described as a romantic comedy. Although the main character is put into some incredibly dangerous situations with extremely convoluted plotlines and some of the situational villains seem to pop up when least expected, I would not class this as a rom-com at all but rather a main character lurching or being forcibly lurched - not a real word but it fits from one dangerous situation to another with a male protagonist who is an antihero for most of the story.',1632182400000),

This second book of Stacys Dry Creek Ranch trilogy does not suffer from middle-story syndrome its clearly the setup for the third book, cousin Sawyers story, but that in no way takes away from Jace and Charlies love story. The continuing story arc involves an ongoing mystery, and we get Cash and Aubreys wedding here as a connection to the first book. My only small complaint is that with the mystery, theres not much room for an epilogue, which I found a bit weak. However, the rest of the tale was told with typical Finz style, characters so real and wounded you want to take them home, and relationships that are complicated and difficult and glorious.

Now she travels the world giving no thought or care toward the two sons who desperately miss her. Jace hasnt forgotten the betrayal, but he isnt holding on to the hurt as much any more. Charlie is on the run, trying to escape her abusive, rich lawyer boyfriend. He has taken control over life, isolating her from everyone else, including her family, and Charlie is now fleeing from him to protect the child she carries. Unfortunately, when she first meets Jace, the county Sheriff, she is having a miscarriage. Jaces compassion for the beautiful and scared Charlie, leads him to giving her a place to stay at his family ranch. A series of events lengthen her stay, and she offers to help take care of his two boys, at least temporarily. Jace knows she is running from trouble, though she refuses to give him any information rather than a trumped up name, she owned a home decor store, and she is passing through. With his two cousins, the co-owners of the ranch, warning him not to get involved with Charlie, and even knowing she is only staying temporarily, Jace cant stop his attraction to the resilient, compassionate and caring woman who has taken her sons under her wing. He helps her with legal matters in an effort to protect her from her ex, lets her use his barn for her design projects and generally falls in love with her. Charlie is not immune to Jace or his boys, and while their relationship soon includes passionate late night encounters, she is waiting for trouble to find her.

One of the things that got me about the writing of this book is how well the flashbacks are done. She delivered just enough to fill in the blanks and move the story along so perfectly. Then adding in the bit of time travel was just the cherry on top. An added bonus is that the if you love the Summerhouse series, you will appreciate this new addition. Olivia is a woman whose life did not turn out the way she thought it was going to. Living an unhappy life for so long can have its toll on a person. But now at 60 years old and a newlywed, she is over the moon on truly living the life she wanted, even though there are doubts and some conversations yet to be had. Kathy in her 40s is married to the man every woman wants and every man wants to be, but he is in love with someone else. Twenty year old, Elise, has a marriage arranged by her parents and their best friends. Her husband has a mistress that is having his baby and takes drastic measures to remove Elise from his life. Whether you believe in fate or not, these three women end up at the Summerhouse. These three women meet and drinks flow, what do they have to lose by opening up to complete strangers with conversations of regrets, wants and dreams. When an unexpected note is delivered the women have an opportunity to go back in time and make their dreams come true. 5 Brilliant stars Review by Lisa, Late Night Reviewer for Up All Night with Books',1585958400000),

However, read the synopsis, read the front inside cover, the mystery isn''t there, we all know. Second, I feel every single scene Brooklyn is in was worthless, especially the tattoo parlour. There''s no character building, no foreshadowing, just the author either trying to introduce us to this character and failing or just adding scenes andor dialogue to reach a word count. The only scenes featuring Brooklyn, that ''worked'' where at the party because that was what broke Riley and during the exorcism. I also think Abuela''s presence in the book was just a filler to also try and reach her word count. Being an avid horror movie fan, I understand the concept of building tension. The author tried, because you never could tell if Abuela was just talking out of her mind or if she truly sensed something evil. However, for me, this had the opposite affect. One more worthless scenes is Sofia''s flashbacks. They are a joke, and not the funny kind. I understand the author wanting to build up what her sin was, but it takes too long, and all those build ups are horrible. I believe the author relied too heavily on gore to keep the story going. It''s like Rob Zombie''s Halloween, the movie itself was pretty boring and at times, down right stupid, but he used gore and a hell lot of it to keep the audience entertained. Same concept applies to this book. I''m not saying I didn''t cringe, because I did once or twice, but the gore became boring very quickly. Grace''s scene at the end, was probably meant to be a huge gore factor and make the reader shiver with uneasiness, because cults and devil worshippers do mutilate bodies in that way what? I study cults in my spare time, but for me it was less scary and more Jesus, give it a rest already. The book dragged on and on. It felt like an eternity to get to the exorcism, which sped by, and then felt like forever before wrapping everything up. There were definitely scenes that didn''t need to be part of the book, that just slowed it down think the tattoo parlour or most of Sofia''s flashbacks. Finally, the ending was horrible. There is no other way to put it. I can honestly say, I didn''t expect the book to end the way it did, but even that couldn''t redeem this. Like many books in a series it ended with a cliffhanger to ensure the readers will be back for more. However, instead of me wanting to read more, I wondered why I wasted my time reading this book in the first place.',1610496000000),

The synopsis essentially spoils 75 of the novel. When I initially read the synopsis, I expected what was mentioned to only be a portion of the novel but it went on for 150 pages. Same scene, same setting. At some point, I was so tired of reading about it I went back and tabbed where the scene started just so I could see how long this really was. The concept of the plot in theory was fantastic I was looking forward to reading it but when I got into the bulk of the story, I was disappointed. Everyone''s actions, words, and just about everything was incredibly one-dimensional. Now, that''s not always a bad thing, but in this case it made for everything being just unbelievable, but not in the exciting sense. It wasn''t even the type of unbelievable where it could be laughable and funny. When I got to the very end, I just rolled my eyes and set the book down. This book was very gory. I can''t recall a time I''ve had a physical reaction to gore in a book but I had a few reading this. There was one scene where I was trying to read the book but also cover up the book at the same time while squirming in my seat and I ended up yelling out loud. If you like gore, this book is for you. There was also a scene with bugs, lots of bugs and I absolutely hated it. I hate bugs and reading about bugs did not go well for me. The scene only lasts a few pages but beware BUGS, specifically cockroaches. Despite my disappointment with the plot execution and the characters, this book had readability. I continued reading purely because I wanted to know what happened, even if I was kind of over it. It was a very bizarre read but even with all of the issues I had and how unbelievable the dialogue was ... I could see myself reading the sequel. Don''t rush out to buy this one, maybe request it from your local library, but stick it on your TBR for a rainy day if you''re looking for something that tackles a darker horror topic with a light hand.',1626652800000),

I think there is a difference between a scary book and a book filled with the torture of a teenage girl. Though the idea that teenage girls could and have done this chills me to my very core I did not find this book scary. So I was a little disappointed in that aspect. However everything else about this book was great. I picked this book up on a whim. Who doesn''t love a bubblegum pink book with pagan symbols on it? I do I love a good spooky witch story. No witches here though. I did feel as though it took until about page 100 or so to start picking up the pace. Then everything just went crazy. There is quite a bit of gore I guess I have read some dark stuff so this didn''t seem as bad to me and thats ok. It wasn''t just thrown in for shock value. You can see why it was used and it was written well. Danielle didn''t just slap dash together the most disturbing stuff she could think of to incite a reaction. Everything that happens has a reason. And once you reach the end you can think back and know how some things were possible, and why some events unfolded as they did. there is kind of an A Ha moment where everything clicks.

On one hand, the concept, writing style, and visuals were fantastic. There is so much creativity and unease and atmosphere here. But I dont think this book was for me. I couldnt quite connect with most of the characters, though I found Verity and Cassius to be my favourites. The setting and world building were subtle, yet solid, and lended into the creepy, tragic, mysterious plot. While the pacing was quite slow and the threads didnt tie up until the end, I was invested enough to keep going. Then things got weird. There were a few twists that I really did not expect, and the ending was absolutely nuts. As in I almost thought I was reading a different book. This is not a bad book. Far from it. But it was not for me. The ending was a little too outrageous compared to how the book began, even though I will admit that some of the visuals will be stuck in my head for a while.

Instead he kept fumbling around, being awful but never quite too awful. Also, the dialogue is A I love Brennan''s quick wit, and this was showed off beautifully. I was constantly giggling over hilarious rebuttals from the women in the story. Read this series for the dialogue, if nothing else',1591401600000),

Thats why I gave it four stars. As for how I enjoyed this book, reading it as an adult, I would be giving it two stars. Natasha Preston did a wonderful job keeping the twists coming and the gas lighting to a maximum. I can see middle schoolers really being creeped out by Iriss actions and enjoying the relationship between Ivy and her boyfriend, Ty. The Twin reminded me of all the Fear Street books I read by R.L. Stine when I was in middle school, its predictable, but at that age, kids love reading the same type of stories over and over and even as adults, there are some people who will only read the same genre. I can see both young adults and adults not enjoying the ending. I know I didnt. It made me angry. But after I let my anger steep a bit, I came to like the ending. Life is rarely fair, so why should I expect a book to be the same? And if I want a happy ending I can always read a cozy mystery or a romance novel. Now to review this book as an adult. The first 20 of the book is Ivy going on about her mothers death and wanting to give Iris space. If Prest0n w0uld have toned that down to 5 of the book and took the extra 15 and added it to the ending to flesh it out more and to not have it be over so quick, I think that would have really improved the book. And I just couldnt get over how mature Ivy and Tys relationship was. Their communication is better than a lot of adults I know It just didnt feel real to me at all. I did like that this could show middle schoolers what goals to set for your relationships though. Then theres the point that even with how solid their relationship is, Ty who seems to be on Ivys side, just suddenly isnt. This really ticked me off, and I think could have added another layer to the store if he would have continued to believe in Ivy. Since Ivy is a straight A student, and seems to be street smart as well as book smart, I just could reconcile the fact that it took her so long to see how devious her twin was. I would think since they hadnt lived together for over six years it would be even easier to see through Iriss lies and schemes. If you know middle schoolers who love to read suspense, they will probably really enjoy The Twin. But if youre an adult and read a lot of suspense and thrillers, you may want to try You are Not Alone by Greer Hendricks and Sarah Pekkenan instead',1643068800000),

It was creepy and interesting and I have to say that the book didnt disappoint at all. This one really reminded me of mashed up episode of Supernatural, The Conjuring, and Mean Girls with Hoarders tossed in for good measure. And I have to say that IT WORKED I have have been in the pahanmoral field for over 20 years and I have to say that this author did a very good job with the ghosty demon aspect of this story. I felt like she did justice to those who cleanse objects etc. And I loved every second of it. The characters in this one were great. I loved Anna and really enjoyed that she was just a normal teenager. She had her faults and well she acted her age How many young adult novels can say that? I know that I have seen some people say that this reads for younger teens and I would have to disagree. Her being 16 in this she sounded just right. I know that my 14 almost 15 year old acts a lot like Anna in some aspects. And over the course of the story she grows and learns that its ok to make mistakes. And its also ok to just let things go. Because in the end no one can make you feel bad unless you let them. Her friends were perfect for this story as well. I do wish we would have gotten a little more romance in this one but I could see that happening in a book two. Her dad although a hoarder was also great. He was understanding for the most part and his new partner was so adorable I love her so much I think that I would love to see a book two that centers around the house being cleaned up. Her dad going forward with healing after his wife''s death. And some romance blooming between some characters. As well as maybe then going on the hunt to start ridding the world of bad spirits etc. Esp. with how this one ended with Anna having a certain connection.

Everybody knows everyone else and none of them know you, the outsider. If something terrible happens to you will they help you or help cover up whatever horrible fate befalls you? Redmarch Lake is on the high end of the weirdness scale. Its clear from the start that this insular community doesnt like insiders and is hiding something awful. Are they a nefarious cult? Do they kidnap travellers and eat them? I obviously watch too many horror movies. As the story unfolds it becomes clear that the strangeness in Redmarch is much deeper and darker than I had imagined. Its a rather terrifying book, especially for those who fear the woods or deep lakes and the things that may lurk within them. I really enjoyed the historical episodes interspersed within the present day story. Many of them were incredibly chilling. I love a good horror story and this one was very entertaining. It kept me engaged from beginning to end and I dont think there was a lull at any point. The conclusion was a bit over the top but it fit with the story and I thought it was a satisfying end.

After reading it again some 10 years later, my love for this series has not changed. However, when reading, you must keep in mind that this series was written in the early 90s by a man. Neither of these things are inherently bad, it is just something to keep in mind, especially if you are a female trying to relate to a male written protagonist. Try not to cast the series off too quickly based on that, as I know many will, as Pike has given this series an incredible amount of life with its interesting backstory and take on history. What I love most about The Last Vampire series is that it deals with so many controversial topics of the time and even now, 24 years later, is still mostly relevant. These books make you ponder your own faith, as well as many others, as Sita ponders her own. I would like to give Pike some credit for how I have grown into adulthoodunbiased, empathetic, and unwilling to cast harsh judgements on others because of Sita and her story.

This book also has a collection of the original 13 stories as well. I read the original story then the story that it inspired to be able to judge how well the author took the elements from the original story and either made them their own or failed to do so. I am not going to review the original stories as everything about their genius and greatness has already been said. She Rode a Horse of Fire by Kendare Blake inspired by Metzengerstein- I love Kendare Blakes writing and was so excited to hear she was going to be in this collection. I read the original story of Metzengerstein before I read this tale. It stays very true to the story while putting a fresh spin on it. I love how the story was told by Eliza a servent in the Barons manor and not the Baron himself. I loved the ending especially the last paragraph and think Poe would be proud that his story inspired this one. Rating 5 stars Its Carnival by Tiffany D. Jackson inspired by The Cask of Amontillado  I loved how this story had a girl PoC main character. I love a great revenge story especially girls getting revenge. So I loved this. It stayed true to the original but made it more modern and easier to connect with the main character. Rating 5 stars Night-Tide by Tessa Gratton inspired by Annabel Lee- Annabel Lee is one of my favorite poems so I was really worried to read this retelling. I loved the twist the author put on it and she keeps the tone of the story true to the tragicness of the poem. Rating 4 stars The Glittering Death by Caleb Roehrig inspired by The Pit and the Pendulum  This one I was very curious about how it would be retold. What is going to be the pit, the pendulum, and who is going to be the stand-in for the Inquisition? I always thought this would be one of the harder Poe stories to retell. I loved it. The direction the author had it go was perfect. Who he picked to be the Inquisition was genius. Rating 4 stars A Drop of Stolen Ink by Emily Lloyd-Jones inspired by The Purloined Letter- I loved The Hearts We Sold by this author so much and I loved this science-fiction take on The Purloined Letter This is my favorite story in the book. The world, characters, and the writing drew me in. The author took Poes story and turned it into so much more. Rating 5 stars Happy Days, Sweetheart by Stephanie Kuehn inspired by The Tell-Tale Heart- The Tell-Tale Heart is one of my top favorite Poe stories. I love that the author added the current issues we face in society into the story. But one change I didnt agree with. Rating 3 stars The Raven Remix by Amanda Lovelace inspired by The Raven- The Raven is a beautiful poem. Lovelace has taken the Raven and turned it into Blackout Poetry. For those who dont know what it is it is blacking out words in a story or poem to make a new one using the words and letters from the original. Personally, I find this an insult to Poe. Also, this seemed like the author was too lazy to retell The Raven. Rating 2 stars Changeling by Marieke Nijkamp inspired by Hop-Frog- I loved how the author retold this story. She stayed true to the story while adding a really imaginative and neat twist. Rating 5 stars The Oval Filter by Lamar Giles inspired by The Oval Portrait- I loved how the author bought social media into this story and made it so modern by setting it in a high school. He thought of the perfect way to bring this story into the present without losing the tone or truth of the original story. Rating 4 stars Red by Hillary Monahan inspired by The Masque of the Red Death- I loved which character the author told this story from. I have always loved the original story of beauty and death and the author turned this into one with beauty and death and another message as well. Rating 5 stars Lygia by Dahlia Adler inspired by Ligeia- No one is better at death and madness than Poe. I thought this retelling was perfect. The author captured Poes story to perfection. The obsession and the madness of the main character perfectly matched Poes main from the original story. This is one of the best stories in this collection of retellings. Rating 5 stars The Fall of the Bank of Usher by Fran Wilde inspired by The Fall of the House of Usher  This story was so unique while keeping all the elements of the original story just mixing them up a bit. I loved all the characters in this story and found the world really interesting. Rating 5 stars The Murders in the Rue Apartelle Boracay by Rin Chupeco inspired by The Murders in the Rue Morgue- I really didnt care for this story. It had nothing to do with the story itself which I thought was a great retelling but I didnt connect with the character telling it. I loved the diversity of the story. Rating 3.5 stars If you are a fan of Poes work or discovering it for the first time I highly recommend this',1599609600000),

I read the blurb on Goodreads, and it did intrigue me somewhat, but I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed this book. It was slightly reminiscent of Lord of the Flies, which I read probably over forty-five years ago. Ms. Liggett puts a modern-day twist on the dystopian genre showing us that women are not necessarily the fairer, weaker sex. The Grace Year is not an easy book to read. It is gritty, disturbing, and dark but also uplifting and hopeful at the same time. This book will keep you thinking long after you have finished reading. The book is both beautifully and harshly written. That may seem contradictory, but its the only way I can explain how I felt while reading it. Harshly because of how all the women are treated in the country of this dystopian setting. The monstrous, nefarious acts the grace year girls inflict upon each other while in exile. Beautiful, at times, because amid the horrors these grace year girls endure some of them find joy in womanhood and friendship. The mental images the author paints with her words seize your heart and soul from the first to the last page. I loved the way the author incorporates flowers throughout the book as a way of communication it showed pure ingenuity. The book grabbed me from the first sentence No one speaks of the grace year. The Grace Year tells the story of a dystopian society where women are perceived to have magical powers that can control and lead men astray. When the women of the county turn sixteen, they are sent away as a group, to spend the year releasing their magic into the wild. Only after they release their magic and are deemed pure can they return to civilization to be wives or work in the fields. I would love to tell you more of the story, but there are many twists and turns that I dont want to reveal. White ribbons for the young girls, red for the grace year girls, and black for the wives. Innocence. Blood. Death. Tierney James, our main character, wants a better life for herself and the women in the country. Tierney is an easy character to relate to, she is strong and resilient, but she also is plagued by self-doubt. There are many other supporting characters, all of which the author does an excellent job of developing. My favorite was Ryker, and I loved the way he saw through Tierneys hard exterior and saw her for the beautiful person she was. The men will never end the grace year. But maybe we can. Although this book is a work of fiction, the authors writing is so vivid and realistic I had no trouble visualizing the entire story. I would love to tell you more of the story, but there are many twists and turns that I dont want to reveal. I highly recommend this book.

I really didnt get this book to start. But I realize now, thats on purpose. Liggett has given us a journey to experience, much like Hunger Games, we may not understand the constructs or the challenges entirely at first and our lead gal doesnt either but as we progress with our leading gal into the dark trenches of reality and truth, we realize that we knew all along we just didnt want to believe it. The truth is messy, dirty, bloody, and not flattering just like real life. Womens Competition This is a powerful story about girls, women, mothers, and childless crones. It is a reminder that we as women are taught to compete not to further ourselves but to keep us apart, because apart we are stronger. I tell my husband all the time about how meeting new women is terrifying for me and how I hate the competition. He tells me I imagine it, but I know that its my imagination. Especially because over the years Ive carefully talked with other women and found out we all feel the same. And so we gain progress inch by inch by quietly discussing our realities. The Grace Year shows us how to start or continue the work that these girls begin. It lifts the veil or the shroud and tells us that not all men are evil, women dont need to compete, and ultimately that change may be slow and our patience is required. Change Comes with Sacrifice From the early chapters of The Grace Year we are shown that not everyone survives, and most return broken or changed so much its difficult to recognize them. As our lead gal progresses through her own Grace Year we, of course, start to see why that is. The knowledge or questions our gal starts with arent even the most important ones she answers throughout the story. Everyone in this story sacrifices something in someway. Its not romantic, pretty or bittersweet. Instead its harsh, bloody and stark as bone. Yet each sacrifice made, and the ultimate ones made at the end, are essential for the progress of our story and characters. Liggett has intertwined them so well that I didnt even realize what was happening to my thoughts and emotions until after I had tears in my eyes. Romance Very few real life relationships are fairy tales. In fact I have yet to meet someone with the perfect fairy tale spouse or life. Its because it doesnt exist and we are reminded of that in The Grace Year sometimes the best you can hope for is that it not be awful. Thus when a small speck of hope and love shows up its all the more powerful. Liggett takes that knowledge of the poignance of love and how we all crave the fairytale and uses it against us. Watch for your emotions to be twisted and at times you wont know what you want to happen, or even have a clue what is next. I recommend staying on the ride and letting yourself be immersed in the difficulties of living in an imperfect world to say the least. Overall While the premise is intense and grabbed me quick its the main character that nearly broke me off from this novel. Thank goodness I didnt give up on it. If you hate our lead gal at the start, find her annoying or just inconsistent thats okay. Theres a purpose to it. Were I to make a suggestion about edits to Liggett, Id recommend that she tweak the introductory chapters to focus more on our lead gal and her male friend and theorize less about the magic. Give us something to at least respect about this girl and keep us reading before shes torn to shreds and rises back up in the most unlikely of ways. I wonder on a reread how Id feel about the beginning. Maybe Id see more to it? Maybe Id see what seemed obvious wasnt as clear as it was portrayed? All I know is there is power when a shift happen. My brain, heart and soul shifted while reading The Grace Year, almost without my knowledge. I felt myself recognizing so many of the things said as true to my own life and experience. Its a treat we get insight into our own lives and makes this a perfect story for the YATeen genre. One of the first books as a pre-teen to make a strong impression on me was The Giver when the apple flies through the air and changes to red. That moment in The Grace Year isnt as clear cut, making it even more impactful in the end, but its there. Hidden under some small YA tropes but once you uncover it, and keep on reading, youll suddenly know that this isnt your average YA girls versus girls book. Its got some magic of its own. Note I wrote this review within minutes of putting this book down. I may not feel as strongly tomorrow and normally I allow myself time to digest a book. But I felt like I needed to capture this emotion I have right now before it disappeared and was replaced with the depression of headline news and our own reality. Ill be intrigued to see how I feel about this book in a week, a month or a year. Do I remember it? Does it stick like The Giver, like Blac',1637625600000),

And it can only be called that. Genius. His stories are so incredibly crafted. This book is a young adult book, but it felt more like a mature middle-grade book. Not quite young adult, but not completely juvenile either. There are definitely mature themes in the book, but the storytelling feels more middle grade. The best things about this book are the premise and the plot. The idea behind the series is exciting. I loved Sanderson''s take on superpowers. The plot is very absorbing. I mercilessly wanted to know what would happen next throughout the story. I was glued to the book. I enjoyed the foreshadowing. I literally could not stop contemplating facets of the plot trying to figure out what the endgame would be. The characters are enjoyable. I wouldn''t say that they are developed extremely well. I felt that they could have been more personal, though I did become fond of them while reading. The world building was sufficient. It wasn''t bad. There was enough information for the reader to understand the scope of things and to set the pace for the story. But it definitely felt nearly bare bones. A story can survive on bread, but a sandwich is definitely better. I would have loved more world-building details sandwiched into this. The romance in the book was actually kind of cute. One scene, in particular, was quite touching. But the romance was only as good as you would expect from a middle-grade book. Nothing extreme or too terribly deep. Overall, I loved this story. I wish that the storytelling had felt more mature, but I did not dislike the book as a whole because of it. I am anxious to read the next book and find out what happens. The premise and the plot really drive this story and make me want to continue the series. If you like books that contain superpowers then I''d give this one a try.',1637625600000),

For me thats mostly what it is a familiarity. Ive seen the Disney version of Sword in the Stone. Ive also seen an early 2000s movie called King Arthur, though I dont recall anything from it. I also have picked up the basics of the main legend here and there. Do you need to know any or more of that to enjoy Once  Future? No. I dont think you do. Will you finish the book and want to read more about the legendary king? Well, I know I do. Retellings of classic tales, whether theyre Pride  Prejudice from a few hundred years back or the Iliad millenia ago, always catch my eye. Putting King Arthur in space grabbed my attention more than most other settings probably would have. How would it work to have knights in space? Where would the sword be stuck? How would magic work up there? My questions were answered in this book in a very entertaining and developed way. I think one of the strengths of this book was that the authors didnt just retel the King Arthur story. King Arthur himself already had his time to do his thing in the story. In fact, he had his chance 41 other times. Its time for Ari, a wanted refugee, to try to bring humankind back together and out from under an evil empirical corporations rule. Shes a reincarnation of Arthur, thousands of years later. This allowed for things to change, modernize, all while sticking with tropes necessary to the myth all while being self-aware of them. The Merlin in this book wont let up on how things should be and who is a version of who. I flew through this book since it was hard to put down often. I havent had a read like this in awhile. While it was great as its own book, Im eager to see what happens in book two of the duology. There was a little bit of a lead-in to that book, and Id really like to see Ari finally fulfill her role as this future Arthur and finish her journey.',1643068800000),

This is a set of books that I am certain I will read again at some point which is pretty high praise from me. I always try to write spoiler free reviews but this review may have some spoilers for the earlier books in the series because I simply don''t know how to avoid that. Honestly, if you haven''t read the prior books in this series you will want to stop read my review at this point and start reading Steelheart instead because it is really that good. This was my least favorite book in the trilogy but it was still an incredibly solid ending to the story. At the start of this book, things aren''t looking to great for David and the rest of the Reckoners. The events that ended the previous book have left them at a bit of a disadvantage. Prof is gone as is Tia which leaves David in charge of the group. David is trying and he has a plan that he hopes can save Prof and change everything. The need a few gadgets and during the groups quest to get their hands on a few they meet Knighthawk who ends up being a wonderful addition to the group. The group that I have grown to know and love are all featured in this book. David and Megan''s romance was adorable. David''s use of metaphors is still something to behold and Megan has learned a lot about controlling her power. Abraham may have been my favorite in this book. He has always been a bit mysterious but I felt like we really got to know him a little bit in this book. Cody didn''t have the same charm for me in this book that he had in the first book in the series. His stories that were fun at the beginning of the series have started to grow a bit stale for me at this point. Mizzy added humor at the right moments in the book but I actually think that Knighthawk''s sense of humor was the most enjoyable. This book has a lot of action and the setting was very interesting. I am still trying to envision a city made of salt in constant change. It sounds odd but it actually worked for me. There was a lot of planning and coming up with ideas in this book for the Reckoners. There was action but most of it seemed to be crammed into the last part of the book. I would have liked to see a little more action spread out in the story. The story took a few twists that I predicted and a few that I didn''t. All in all, I found it to be a nice ending to the series but not quite as good as I had hoped it would be. I would highly recommend this series to anyone looking for something a little different. If the idea of a world where individuals with powers are not the heroes but the villains sounds even remotely interesting, I would suggest that you give Steelheart a try. I have enjoyed everything that I have read by Brandon Sanderson up to this point but I still have some catching up to do. I plan to read a lot more Sanderson in the future.',1580601600000),

Not only was the premise of the whole story the approaching of an end-of-the-world asteroid explained much better but a few intriguing hints were thrown in to keep you guessing how the next couple of books might develop I believe that there will be 4 books in the series altogether. Hard SciFi devotees might be disappointed as this book is set in a futuristic scene but is mostly about the personalities and the heroine, Gwen, in particular. Indeed, whilst SciFi themes are explored, this is very much a love story. And oh what fun it was to read,with that all-important surprising but satisfying ending. I loved it so much that I reread the last section and was sorely tempted to start the book all over again... something I would never normally contemplate. So, I can''t recommend this book highly enough and I just wish the author would hurry up and write the next one. Now that really will give me an excuse to read the first two again',1591401600000),

From who youll marry, the job youll have, they even promise you a fulfilling life all the way up to age eighty, where you pass away peacefully never feeling useless or unwanted. Your life is controlled by three tablets green, blue and red. No one knows what the red tablet does, people believe it is a death tablet, but the Society fends off those rumors. The blue tablet is given at age 10 it is filled with enough nutrients to keep you alive for several days. The green tablet is given at age 13 it will make you calm, but you can only use it once a week. The red tablet is given at age 16, and is only to be used when instructed. Where the world is finally at a state of content, the Society seems perfect on the outside. But inside at Mapletree Borough, one girl finds the flaw that runs deep into the bones of the way of life. Cassia follows the rules. She always had, and thought she always would. Her family consists of her mother, father and little brother Bram, who have lived in Mapletree Borough all their life. Everything was peaceful, or so they thought. The day of the Match Banquet was a series of preparation for the girls of Mapletree. As at age seventeen the girls will find out which boy they have been destined to marry, and a chance to show off their beauty by wearing colorful dresses, instead of their regular brown, black or gray clothes. Cassia was especially excited as this was the day shes been dreaming of, showing up as the only girl in a bright green dress. Her match, well it was an unusual one as she was matched with her best friend since childhood Xander. It seems like a fairy tale as both families were excited, Cassias peers were jealous as Xander was a good cached, and with their memories of playing in the sandbox together, they were a perfect match.Cassia was happy, at least until she put her card in to find out all about Xanders life and saw a face that wasnt Xanders staring back at her, instead it was a different boy, one she knew, but never got to know well. His name was Ky. Ky Markham was Cassias second matched. This has to be a mistake as you cannot be with two people, yet the Society doesnt make mistakes. It hurt Cassia even more as she knew Ky, they went to school together, and have hung out a few times. Where Cassia was perfectly happy to be with Xander, she couldnt help wonder why she and Ky were matched up, even if it was a mistake. For her summer activity she picked hiking, and was shocked when Ky was there too, and the Offical had paired them up. For many trips with Ky up The Hill, Cassia starts to learn about his story, about the story of the Society, and how even though they told her to be with Xander, she wanted to be with Xander, she couldnt help but fall in love with Ky. With a love triangle forming it is up to the Society to cut this tree down, before it can start causing real trouble. Ally Condie had a good story line going, yet the characters fell flat. The Society similar to the one in The Giver had a good backbone, with a little mention of how our society fell they had rules, normal and weird no running outside of the track, and a general order to keep the people controlled. Yet I felt nothing for Cassia. Maybe it was the fact that the story was a love triangle, but the love Cassia has supposedly fallen for Ky and Xander never felt strong, let alone reality. It was a good start, but to keep this story going there needs to be a strong character development event coming. Check out more of my book reviews at TeenageReads.com',1577836800000),

With every characters pain your heart aches for them and every mistake you wish to fix. Jonas is a careful, kind boy with pale eyes. His mother is a Judge and always takes the logical side but his father is a Nurturer and he was always the softer and more convincing person. Silly and playful seven year old Lily is Jonass younger sister. Jonas was watched as a child and now, at his Ceremony of Twelve, he is selected to be the Receiver. Jonas has been selected to be our next Receiver of Memory, the words echoed through the community. Jonas and his friends start growing apart because, in this community, Sameness is what everyone is focused on. It is considered rude to talk about your differences. Even when you have the Ceremony of Twelve you are singled out to be with people who are the same as you, but Jonas is completely alone to be the Receiver, no one who is the same. Asher and Fiona were Jonass friends. Asher is a very immature and careless eleven years old but when he is assigned to be the Recreational Director, he grows up a little. Fiona is kind and gentle and likes to spend her volunteer hours at the House of Old, so her assignment there was very predictable. Jonas and his friends grew apart because they had absolutely nothing in common. Jonas knew about things that nobody else did and that tore him apart from everybody else. Jonas got upset when Asher was playing war games because nobody knew how horrible war was and Asher got annoyed at Jonas for trying to tell him. Fiona got tired of hinting at Jonas to tell about his job and just stopped trying. Gabe is an Uncertain newchild with pale eyes like Jonas who comes to live with their family unit. Jonas is so wrapped up in his own issues that he does not notice that Gabriel is having trouble sleeping. As an Uncertain newchild, Gabe has been granted another year to learn how to sleep properly. If in that year, Gabriel is not able to sleep soundly without disturbing his family unit, then Gabe will be released. Jonas, finally aware of what release is, gets upset that nobody cares that they are being killed. But they do not know what murder is and believe that they are just doing what is best for the community. Sameness is encouraged in the community but nothing is really felt. Even a family unit has no love for each other. Nobody actually lives with their child and nobody picks who they want to spend their life with. They say that sameness ensures no conflict. Yet at the hand of their own people, they are killing a newchild just because he has a twin. I am usually mad at this community because while Sameness does create a peaceful community with no conflict, nobody feels love or pain. Nobody chooses their happiness. It gets handed to them based on personality. Jonas gets selected to be the Receiver of Memory and during his training with the Giver, who transports the memories to him, he gives Jonas memories of war. Jonas gives up a little. He insists to himself that he does not want it he does not want the honor. However Jonas goes back every day and learns how the community does things right but he also learns how much they have taken away. Jonas feels Love for the Giver, a feeling he had never experienced before. The pale eyes they have in common is a sign for their connection. The Giver truly cares about Jonas and does not enjoy giving painful memories to Jonas. It makes me sad that Jonas finds it hard to understand how much their lives were starved from emotions. It makes me want to desperately help him imagine our independence where we pick our own jobs, our own lovers, and ultimately our own lives. I want Jonas to know that conflict makes our lives stronger. I want him to know that differences should be welcomed, and that solving conflict will not weaken you. This book made me feel really emotional because Jonas was really strong and wanted to help the community even when everybody else gave up. This book will make you feel so many emotions which is funny because strong emotions are forbidden in their community. I recommend this book to everybody because you will love this heartfelt, impactful book at any age from ten and up this book will make you ache from your head to your toes but this book will also fill you with bliss, and delight.',1577836800000),

He is very proper and usually organized. In the beginning, it struck me he saw many unusual things that lots of other community members didnt see. I liked him because he was very interesting and he always knew what he was doing. His friends name is Asher. Asher is often clumsy and makes lots of mistakes. I got the feeling that Asher was less responsible and often made mistakes and jokes. This story takes place in a community full of Sameness. People who live here dont have feelings and cant see Color. This community is controlled and nobody is allowed to have feelings, at some point they start feeling things but they all get controlled, the children have to take pills to stop their feelings and emotions from growing. They also use really interesting vocabulary that is controlled too. As the storys plot unrolls we meet Jonass parents who are not his actual parents because in this community there are birth mothers who have to have 3 children and no more. These children have their families chosen for them. I liked Jonass father because he wasnt as straightforward about things as Jonass mother. I didnt like his mother because I found her too strict and proper all the time. she never broke the rules and always corrected Jonas. At first, it is confusing but we meet a baby named Gabriel, a regular baby who just isnt adjusting to the environment and need special assistance, if he doesnt manage to learn he would have to be released. Jonass dad decided to take care of the baby and bring him home. I was really surprised because it was very rare for parents do such things in the community. I felt happy for Gabriel because I saw a slight connection between Gabriel and Jonas from the start because the first thing Jonas saw was Gabriels pale eyes just like his own. We are with Jonas when he goes to the ceremony of 12 where all the 12s get assigned their jobs for life. I found it rather peculiar that they get their jobs assigned for them at the age of 12. I was very surprised and scared when the Chief Elder skipped his name, but it turned out he was given the job of being the new receiver of memory. When I heard it, I was really excited because I always got the feeling that he was different from all the others and that he had a special gift and ability to See Beyond. The day after the ceremony, Jonas meets the Giver. The first thing we are told is that the Giver also has pale eyes like him and that really got me thinking if it was a hidden message of some kind. The Giver has a very interesting character. He is really calm and dedicated. I could see that he had been through a lot of painful memories. He was my favorite character because of his calm personality and the way he always analyzed everything. In Jonass first session with the Giver, the Giver makes him lie down on his stomach and tells him to close his eyes. Then he puts his hand on Jonass back and starts passing a memory. He suddenly appears in a snowy mountain and sees a sled, at first he doesnt know what it is but soon he sits down on it and starts going down the mountain. The cool wind brushes against his face and he is enjoying himself. That was my favorite memory because I also love winter so I could relate to him. I felt the same joy as he did when I sat on a sled for the first time. Soon Jonas starts getting feelings for Fiona another 12 who has red hair and is really nice. When he tells his parents about it, they tell him to start taking the pills that will stop his feelings for Fiona. I was really frustrated after that event because its human nature to have feelings, and the fact that this community stops it with pills really made me angry. One day, Jonas asked the Giver if there are any painful memories the giver knows suffering from. The Giver knows a lot of painful memories but decides not to tell him just now because he might not be strong enough but Jonas insists and the Giver has no choice but to give them to Jonas. Jonas was very brave but I felt like he wouldnt be able to take the pressure and pain. The Giver Jonas a memory of war and Jonas got too shocked and frightened to stay after seeing the memory. I think I would have reacted in the same way if I had suddenly been told about such a painful memory and seen people play it as a game. I dont want to give away the ending but Ill tell you that I felt really sad in the end and I just put down the book. I wish Lois Lowry had made the ending a little more, but then again I can understand that she wanted the reader to predict the ending instead of her personal feelings getting mixed on the ending. I really liked this book and it made me think of how lucky we are that we get to make our own choices but this book also got me thinking.

It''s been a long time since I read a book that I really struggled to put down, an even if this one didn''t really reach the whole way to the top there, it was one of the better ones in a long while. I do find it a bit dragging towards the middle and at the end, but at the same time the ending part may just be because I was too eager to find out what happened and didn''t have the patience to wait for it. And this time I remember the main character, David unlike after the first book in the series. I also loved how he evolved in this one and how things about the Epics got more explained to the reader. I love the way Sanderson have developed the main character, and the way he has made us see this boys nerdy personality even if David himself hates being called a nerd. He''s such a fun character to follow in this book and his language is what brings light into an otherwise dark story. The writing is superb and it makes me curious to read more book by the author. I like this book a lot better than the first one in the series, Steelheart, but I also believe that I needed the knowledge from Steelheart to enjoy this book too. So if you want to read this series, do it in order. Judging by the name though, I thought the book would be more about Firefight than what it was, but at the same time I like the setup just the way it is.

Todd is not portrayed as some chosen, special teen, like in a lot of today''s dystopian young adult fiction. He is just a boy, and it''s refreshing. Todd''s relationship with Viola is hardly romantic in this first part of the trilogy, and that''s actually a good thing. They get closer, but he doesn''t spend the book wondering about when they''re going to kiss and stuff like that. They''re young and cute and they have better things to worry about. For now. The Spackle are the native species of the planet, and they are set up nicely. From what little you see of them, they are very likable. I named a stuffed animal after them. Also, I was very impressed with Todd''s struggle with killing. You don''t see that very often in books, and I think it''s realistic and made me like both the book and Todd more than I did to begin with. In a good deal of young adult books, teens kill the bad guys like they don''t even care. If they''re bad, then sure. They can die. Sometimes it seems like there''s not much of a choice, but I applaud the authors that make it a real issue. Where the main character won''t kill, or atleast struggles with it a lot. The only other book like that off the top of my head is the Harry Potter series, where it''s acknowledged that killing rips apart your soul to some extent. The poor spelling and grammar, I think, is more endearing than annoying. The Noise, which is the thoughts of all the males, is portrayed really well.

The characters felt so real and I found myself growing incredibly attached to them. I have to admit, I was a little bit confused at the very start of this book, but once the plot developed a little and I got to know a bit more about the characters and the world, everything fell into place and I was hooked. I would love to be able to tell you more about the character development and the world building, but saying anything more would put me at risk of spoiling you, and I really think it is best to go into this book without knowing too much about the plot. One thing that surprised me about The Knife of Never Letting Go is how dark it was. Our main character, Todd, is only supposed to be twelve or thirteen during this book there is some debate among the characters as to the progression of time on their planet. This is a little bit younger than a typical Young Adult character, and this book is marketed as YA. Despite Todds age, I found this book to be darker than most YA books I have read. The villains in this world are some of the creepiest, slimiest characters I have ever read. I have heard Mayor Prentiss named as peoples favorite villain multiple times, and, I will admit, he is a really creepy bad guy and I am a little afraid to see what he does in the rest of this series. But the character that really got to me in The Knife of Never Letting Go was Aaron. Aaron was freaking CRAZY. He completely creeped me out and I will never forget his scenes in this book. Ugh, that guy gives me chills.',1640304000000),

One of the two first person narrations is from the character of Cassie, who had a lot of personality. At times, I found her character to be a bit annoying, though. She is still really just a child, so her chapters are immature. She is strong, but also weak. While she portrays a very strong image, she is actually very fragile. I thought she had strong moments, but even those were clouded with her true weak nature. The second character who tells his story in first person narration is Ben. Ben was more developed than Cassie, but I think his character needed the development more because he goes through a transformation. Ben starts out sick and weak, but becomes a strong leader by the end. Overall, he''s a strong character. Then, there are a couple other characters that we get a third person narration of. One of whom is Sammy, Cassie''s five-year-old brother. I thought that Sammy''s character was very well-written. Overall, I thought the characters were good, even with their minor flaws. I thought that Yancey''s writing was good. He definitely has a unique writing style that changed accordingly depending on the point of view. The story was good. However, I don''t think it''s as good as a lot of other peoplereviewers have been saying it is. There were a bunch of small things I didn''t like about it, such as the insta-love and Cassie''s chapters. I also found that it ended very abruptly, which was a little disappointing. There was no wind-down, just all of a sudden BOOM, the story''s over I''m also unsure of my opinion of Evan, which is why I didn''t bring him up in my character-breakdown. I don''t understand him or the decisions he made. The thought of his decisions and just him as a character frustrated me. I think that teens would enjoy this one more than adults. I think that The 5th Wave is still enjoyable for adults, it''s just that Cassie''s chapters are a bit childish, which may or may not botherannoy an adult reader such as myself. I would recommend this novel to a younger audience or anyone who is a fan of Young Adult.',1645833600000),

I like the world building, but not everything get explained. Kade is supposedly a young Stormer, but the description makes me think of someone older and more experienced. His way of sometimes ignoring orders is the only thing that makes him young in my eyes. Still, I''m quite fond of Kade. Sure, he''s a bit grumpy when he has to take care of the newbie Hadley, but later we can see that he''s rather thoughtful. Hadley is trying to keep a low profile when she joins the Stormers so it takes a while before we get to know her. As a girl masquerading as a boy she sometimes end up in awkward situations which, in turn, was awkward to read about. There''s nothing strange with Hadley being scared and unsure, but it got a bit tiresome with her teary eyes and lip chewing. In spite of that, she does some things that take a lot of courage, even if it''s not expressed as much. Both Kade and Hadley grew on me while I read. The mission both of them is sent on proves to be a bit mysterious.

I found the plot to be a bit boring at first, so it took me a while to get interested in the book. The pace did eventually pick up, though, and I found myself not wanting to put the book down. By the end, I was completely hooked. I also thought the world that Marie Lu created was really interesting, but I wish she had provided more history about how it came to be. The story takes place in our future, and the Eastern and Western United States are at war. We don''t get to learn how the United States ended up that way, though, and I think that would have been an interesting story. I really enjoyed the characters of Day and June, as well as the supporting cast of characters. It took me a while to get invested, but I eventually grew to really care for them and their story. Something that I particularly appreciated was the way the romance was handled. June and Day definitely became enamored with one another, but I didn''t feel like there was any instalove at all. The romance was developed well and was relatively believable. And there wasn''t a love triangle Yay I am not a huge fan of romance, so the way this one was handled made it much more enjoyable for me. My biggest gripe about Legend was how easy the plot was at times. The characters would encounter clues and then immediately figure them out without any trouble. Everything was a bit too convenient and predictable. The book wasn''t incredibly long, so I feel like there was room for a little extra development within the plot. Even a paragraph here and there with the characters trying to interpret the clues could have made a big difference. While I enjoyed the story, every time the characters figured out a clue immediately, I had to roll my eyes a bit.',1632182400000),

While I did live in St. Louis for a year, I was a kid and have no allegiance to the city. Some of the other reviews Ive read claim bias by the author and I cant speak to that. All I can say is that the premise of this book pulled me in. It was billed as a riveting, often scandalous saga of the rise and fall of the dysfunctional Busch familyan epic tale of prosperity, profligacy, hubris, and the dark consequences of success that spans three centuries, from the open salvos of the Civil War to the present day. You get no less than what was promised The reign of the Anheuser-Busch brewery began with the founder August Busch, which passed to his son, Gussie, then to Gussies son, August III, and finally to August IV. Who promptly lost control of the company in a hostile takeover. The takeover was actually due in no small part to his inability to run a company of any size, let alone one the size of Anheuser-Busch. This book was fascinating The history of the company was presented in a clear and concise manner that was interesting reading and kept me turning the page to see what would happen next. The first three generations to run the company were businessmen who were obsessed with their firm, and did what it took to ensure they left a legacy for the next generation. Along the way the family was certainly dysfunctional, but by the time IV took over, it was inevitable that the self-indulgent playboy would lose the company or drive it into the ground. Knoedelseder presents the business side of the story in a manner that is not dry and boring. As for the family side of the story, I knew they were wealthy, but I dont think I quite knew the extent of their wealth. Or how much money they spent on foolish indulgences. The only saving grace is that they did actually contribute to charities. The family tale is a sordid one, with one scandal after another, including the deaths of two women associated with August IV. It appears he still has not grown up. In June of 2017, he was arrested for DUI. He happened to be trying to drive his helicopter. No charges were filed. I thought this was a quite interesting read. The only thing that I would have liked to have learned about was how the demise of Anheuser-Busch affected St. Louis, and how August III didnt do something to stop the takeover. httpscandysplanet.wordpress.com',1626652800000),

It is an interesting read, reflecting on many aspects of his life. One can certainly understand why writing this book was timely for him, given his cancer diagnosis. Alex describes interesting experiences which made him the man he is, and he has included many scenarios. Several friends, upon hearing that I was reading this book, asked me if I thought Alex had a ghost writer. I replied that I doubted that a ghost writer was used because Alex is very intelligent and should be capable of writing such a book on his own. Alex was born and raised in Sudbury, Ontario and graduated from the University of Ottawa before working for some years at the CBC in Toronto, so many of the experiences described occurred in Canada. About 75 through the book, I wondered if perhaps someone else did do some of the writing. At this point in the book, Alex discusses the importance of a studio audience to a quiz or game show such as Jeopardy. After moving to Los Angeles to pursue his career, Alex hosted several different shows before he became the host of Jeopardy, he hosted a show which was filmed in Vancouver. Regarding the importance of a live audience to such shows, he describes an experience regarding this show, stating that on one day of taping the winter weather was so severe in Vancouver that that the audience couldn''t get to the theatre, so they had to improvise by having crew members sit in audience seats. I live in Vancouver, and anyone familiar with Vancouver knows that Vancouver winters are mild rarely does the temperature dip to freezing, and there is very little snow unlike in eastern Canada. So I began to wonder about who wrote of this experience because surely Alex Trebek knows that winter in Vancouver is not at like winter in Sudbury or Ottawa. The chapters in The Answer is . . . Reflections on my life are very short, divided into specific areas of his life and interests, and the book is written in a casual style. An entertaining read',1610496000000),

He was in our living room many, many nights. He helped me develop my love of trivia. Right from the outset of the book, I knew I would enjoy it. His writing style is very conversational. I can almost hear his voice. The chapters are all short, he is reminiscing about individual occurrences in his life. He goes through his life sequentially. His dry humour comes through at all times. And sometimes he''s corny. He is not afraid to laugh at himself. And, he is a humble man. I love his stoicism. I love his thirst for knowledge and understanding in so many ways, he reminds me of my father. Great photos throughout the book, of his wife, parents, and children. A view into the private lives of the Trebeks. The subject matter of chapter is in the form of a question What is...........? It''s a great tribute to the game. There are all sorts of interesting facts about the game. Naturally, there are chapters devoted to each, Ken Jennings and James Holzhauer. There are a couple chapters about other contestants also. The last few chapters are less upbeat. He accepts that he is nearing the end of his life and is not afraid. I''m not sure if this qualifies as a book review or my thoughts on Alex Trebek. I''m glad I read it and I believe I read it at the right point in time. RIP Alex. You will be missed.',1645833600000),

In a big way, this is because of Lauren Grahams character, Lorelai Gilmore. And because of this, I picked up Grahams novel Someday, Someday, Maybe when it came out. I enjoyed it. Graham isnt just a talented actor, shes a great writer. When I heard about Talking as Fast as I Can, I got even more excited than I did for Grahams novel. Turns out, my excitement was warranted. Grahams fiction is great, but her non-fiction is even better. One of my favorite parts of this book was where Graham reacts to each of the Gilmore Girls seasons. It was great to get the actors own thoughts on what Ive watched dozens of times over the last fifteen or so years. And the section where Graham discusses all that was involved in making Gilmore Girls A Year in the Life happen, I gained a better appreciation for just what went into its creation. But the Gilmore Girls and Parenthood parts of this book werent all that made it what it is. Getting to hear about how Someday, Someday, Maybe came to be makes me want to read it again. And hearing about Grahams early life was also a reason I wanted to read this book in the first place. Being part memoir, part essays on various projects and key issues, this collection is a great read on many levels. I only wish it were longer. I want more from Graham. But Im happy to wait for another novel or a similar non-fiction book. Id read anything that comes out. Its not just my inner fan-girl talking.

In the third season of American Housewife, Wong has had even more screen time then just during second breakfast, and I was so happy. I laughed so hard during her comedy specials and often chuckle when shes in American Housewife, so I was really disappointed that her book was not more funny to me. I think for me to enjoy her humor I need to see her performing it. Her facial expressions, her tone of voice, and how she gestures wildly towards her private parts really adds to the comedy. In the book she mentions numerous times how she would bend over and moon the audience. You just dont get the same visuals reading a book as you do watching the performance. And the end chapter by her husband really left a bad taste in my mouth, which is a horrible last impression for a book. He goes on about how much he is doing for their children and sacrificing for Wong to be able to do her job. Even typing this, Im shaking my head in annoyance. Now with all that negative feedback, if you like Ali Wong, I still think you should read the book.

My thoughts and opinions are 100 my own and independent of receiving an advance copy. Stand up comedian, actress, and writer, Ali Wong can now add author to her list of accomplishments. You might recognize her from her Netflix specials Baby Cobra or Hard Knock Wife. Or maybe youve seen her Netflix movie Always Be My Maybe. The movie where the meme with Keanu Reeves went viral. If you havent seen it, google it - and youre welcome. She has written a book in the style of letters to her daughters. Each chapter has cute headings like How I Trapped Your Father and A Guide To Asian Restaurants. But if you think that she has toned down her language, she hasnt. This is on-brand Ali Wong. Be prepared for a crass, dirty, vulgar style that she is known for. It is very similar to her stand up. If you enjoy her comedy routines you will love this book. If not, maybe watch a special before buying this one. I am a bit in the middle with this one. It was okay, there were some funny parts, some cringe-worthy parts and some yawnable moments. You get some real moments, but not enough. It would have helped me feel more connected to the book had we had more realness. It seemed distant in some ways. I think if you love her humor, you will find lots to laugh at. Im not in love with potty humor so sometimes I felt like really, again? I understand why she makes those choices, but I dont like it in men any more than I do in women. Im not offended that a woman is saying these things. I just am not a big fan. I was still left wanting more after reading this book. I dont think you get to know her any better from the book, than what you see up on stage. She says herself the those are just caricatures of real people. So I felt like I was reading a caricature of Ali Wong. Not getting to really know her. The most personal moment in the book is the letter her husband writes in the afterwards. There are some funny parts, but it isnt laugh out loud, hilarious all the way through. As I said, maybe her fans will really love it. Just okay for me.',1618531200000),

All in all, I left knowing these guys and their story and wanted to know more even than what was there. Ad Rock Adam Horowitz is extremely funny, but both he and Mike D are good writers, as you would expect. Also, don''t expect much kiss and tell here--there are no sex stories at all only one or two vague mentions. There is only one story about marijuana use, though it is alluded to a lot along with alcohol. Nothing mentioned about harder drugs. Whether that''s tame or lame is in the eye of the beholder, but don''t expect anything wild. If anything, they come across as pretty innocent, smart, funny guys.

I used to adore reading the choose your own adventure books as a child although I would never choose the right option and always ended up dying of thirst or some other horrible death. I would eventually give up on my ability to make the right choices and try to figure out what I needed to choose by working backwards in the book. Despite my poor decision making skills, I never gave up on these books. Every time I brought home a Scholastic flyer from school, I would end up picking out another one of those books. I am the same age as Mr. Harris so it makes some sense that he would fondly remember these books as well as I do and I just love the fact that he used this approach in this book. There is just something about Neil Patrick Harris that seems to be almost universally appealing. I am not a biography reader. I probably read a few back in high school and college because I had to but I can''t think of a time where I picked one up to read for entertainment as an adult....but I wanted to read this book as soon as I heard about it. I am not exactly sure what I find so entertaining about Mr. Harris. Sure I have watched and enjoyed some of his work. His portrayal of Barney Stinsen is...wait for it....legendary. I loved him in Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle. I just have never considered myself to be a huge fan though. If he is on, I''ll certainly watch him but I don''t go out of my way to be sure to catch him either. I still knew that I had to read this book because there is just something about the way that he tells a story. One thing that I think is genius about this book is the fact that I will certainly be picking it up quite a few more times. It is a choose your own adventure so you have to read it several times just to make sure that you have read every option available. This is a book that I recommend reading as intended with all of the jumping around and choices because it just makes it so much fun. I have been through quite a few options so far with a few ending in a less than ideal manner. I don''t think that the book would be nearly as appealing if it were to be read cover to cover. Neil Patrick Harris does have an interesting story to tell. He is a child star that I will always think of as Doogie to some extent. He also talks about his sexuality, his family, and all the things that make him who he is. Some of the parts in the book are simply silly and I liked those just as much as anything else. The book itself looks wonderful. I just love the cover and the section in the center of the book filled with photos is nice to have. I would recommend this book to others. It is witty, funny, touching, and sometimes thought provoking. Plus it is just a lot of fun This is the first book by Neil Patrick Harris that I have read but I look forward to see what kind of original spin he might apply to a novel in the future. I received a copy of this book from Blogging for Books for the purpose of providing an honest review.',1615766400000),

It all seems like common sense stuff that ends up sounding clichd and overly familiar. Have you read Teri Hatcher''s memoir Burnt Toast? It suffered the same fate, going from interesting to preachy. Garth seems like a nice person, but a strong memoir writer she is not. There are many instances where she doesn''t quite remember, or she doesn''t remember correctly - not the greatest recipe for a memoir. The point is you should only let us know what you do remember and leave out the stuff you''re iffy on. Also, her style and grammar are at times unnerving.

She supported him and his antics at her own expense. Not many women would stand behind a man like this. I say stand behind, because she didn''t always have the opportunity to stand beside him.

From the dynamics and often contemptuous process of getting the show aired not only on time, but as close to the actual plan established before hand, the reader will often be surprised as to how the SNL staff could maintain this controlled, and sometimes uncontrolled chaos while at the same time breaking the mould, and all the rules previously held in producing a variety show. Interesting anecdotal accounts of the close relationships among the writers, actors, production staff, not to mention the drug use, animosity, if not absolute disdain the stars, including Lorne Michaels had for the suits and censors who many believed were in league with evil itself while trying to smother the creative process of a show that set a new bar, established its own protocol for production that were previously thought to be at the very least absurd, while at the same time becoming the prototypical model for success in the new era of irreverent television. While Doug Hill and Jeff Weingrad manage to deliver this chaos to the reader in a direct but many times repetitive manner and terminology of expression, they still manage to come away with a book that peeks through the cracks in revealing the inner workings and the genesis of a comedic and cultural paradigm shift starting with the little known at the time, Not ready for prime time players. You will never again look at the original cast''s shows in the same way after reading about the fights that took place minutes before air or look at the guest host knowing the atmosphere was thick with disdain seconds before a famous one liner is verbalized for the first time on National television. Well worth the read if you''re a SNL fan of the 70''s, or even if you''re not you can still be amazed at how this small group of comedic geniuses, led and protected by a producer whiz-kid thumb their collective noses at conventionality while teenagers in schools across the continent mimic the latest SNL lexicon and characters memorized for class from the Saturday night previous.',1602288000000),

I was looking for Postcards from the Edge or Surrender the Pink, tho I''ve read both. Neither seems to have made it to digital. I wanted to hear CF''s voice one more time--and it''s certainly on display here. In this short memoir more ''random thoughts'' she explains how she decided on electro-shock therapy to help her with her depression and why she now uses it frequently. In part of the reminiscences, she recounts some more recent events that led her back into drugs and alcohol--and lost her custody of her then-young daughter Billie. She seems to have a much closer and more tolerant relationship with Debbie than she ever showed in her novels. And she forgave Eddie so much than she spent the last 7 years of his life caring for him and learning to love him. Of course her acerbic, self-deprecating voice is there--loud and clear. And though this was written 6-8 years ago there''s some overlap with her one-woman show--and book--Wishful Drinking, there is an uncanny awareness of mortality, including her own. At one point she says, ruefully, to her younger friends Someday you''ll be playing pool and a newsflash will come on the bar TV. There''ll be my Princess Leia picture and two dates--the beginning and the end. And you''ll turn to each other and say, ''Yeah, she said it was going to be like that.''

Thank you In no way does this affect my rating or review. Content Warning Exploitation, Death of a loved one, Prejudice, Attempted burglary The Phantom Twin is an incredibly easy story to get into. I read this graphic novel in one sitting, in less than an hour. I devoured it. Set in 1920s America, the travelling freak show was a major crowd-drawer. Back then, the world looked very different than it does today, and was naive. Anything abnormal automatically drew both unwanted and wanted attention--hence, why the show was formed. It is also why the show had both real and fake freaks as people werent always the wiser. For two sisters, Jane and Isabel, also known as Jan-Iss, their condition was nothing but real. Born Siamese-twins, the Peabody sisters were attached at the side, sharing an arm and a leg. Jane, the outgoing, sassy, and domineering twin, wanted nothing more than to get out of the carnival to get married and have a family. Isabel, shy, quiet, and passive felt at home with the family they had created with the other members of the show. The two are approached one night after a show by a physician who believes he can help their situation. Jane eagerly jumps on the opportunity, and drags Isabel to a medical consultation to discuss their options further. The physician, believing their physical separation would be a seamless procedure, encourages the two to undergo the procedure for his own medical career and credibility. What comes of the procedure, however, is the exact opposite of the desired result. When the procedure is completed at the expense of Janes life, Isabel must now go on living for the first time, alone. She undergoes a lot of emotional turmoil and borderline depression, while trying to find her place in the world. Without her sister, and missing an arm and a leg from the procedure, Isabel finds herself having to relearn daily living, and how to compensate for what has been lost. In regards to the artwork, I found it fitting for the story told. The muted colors give the story an old-timey feel, which is obviously desired. There is also a certain harshness in the childlike artistry that conveys melancholy as well as isolation. The Phantom Twin is a quick read that easily submerges the reader into the cruel lifestyle on the darker side of the circus, accompanied with loss, but eventually, love. Vulgarity Minimal. Sexual content Minimal - cat calls, jeering, kissing Violence Minimal. My Rating ????',1605052800000),

Is that there''s no sign this will become a series. Which sucks, because I love the story and characters There is a lot of comedy, but the narrative takes it''s world building seriously. I laughed out loud and came close to crying several times. Julius is a great love interest. He is super capable as a sorcerer, but also cold by tempermant as well as believably flawed. Especially when it comes to social interaction and things outside magic. He''d be nothing though without the weakest manga Villainess and excellent romantic foil Elle. She is selfless without coming across as goody goody. She is a hilarious tsundere without coming across as cliche. She is absolutely adorable without those cute moments coming across as pandering or contrived. She is an excellent main character and she needs to be, as many around her seem to agree, protected. So yeah. I really really really surprisingly enjoyed this story, and really really really wish there was more coming.

This does not affect my opinion. I went into Under Rose-Tainted Skies looking for a good, compassionate story about a girl living with mental illness and maybe to swoon a bit. I got both of those in abundance. I was also able to develop an incredibly strong connection to the characters which is a huge draw for me. I loved how mental illness was treated in this book. Norah proves that you can be incredibly compelling, likable, witty, etc. and suffer from mental illness contrary to what long-standing stigmas may suggest. Her relationship with Luke is also amazing if more people were able to help those close to them struggling with mental illness the way Luke does with Norah, many lives would change for the better. I also love seeing Norah''s thoughts on it and how her everyday life is affected and also seeing her try to progress. There''s no magic cure for mental illness but we can all work together to make it manageable and support those around us that need it. I also wanted to swoon and I got that. As I''m sure you can guess from my mention of how Luke is with Norah, he ends up getting his very own book boyfriend membership card. He''s funny, caring, kind, a little bit nerdy but also still cool, and an overall amazing character. I love them individually as characters and I loved their dynamic in dealing with one another. Norah''s idea of talking to a guy she likesflirting is soooo in line with how I am so it was nice to see another awkward girl because I always end up super envious of the girls in books that have great skills for talking to boys. I found myself not wanting to stop reading Under Rose-Tainted Skies when I had to take breaks for inconvenient things like work, meals, bathing, etc. It''s not a fast-paced action story obviously but I was so incredibly invested that I flew through the book. The pacing was good and wanting Norah and Luke to hurry up and become a thing made it a quick read. This is easily one of my favourite YA books that touches on mental illness. I loved the story, the characters, the portrayal, the journey. I definitely recommend Under Rose-Tainted Skies if you''re looking for a cute contemporary read that also sheds some light on life with mental illness.',1643068800000),

But since she didnt develop these illnesses until she was a little older, she still remembers what it was like to be normal.

He plants a desire in her to be normal that is so strong, she almost starts to believe its possible. Can she conquer the illnesses that have imprisoned her for years? Or will she just have to accept the fact that she cant change the way things are? This was a really, REALLY good book. Aside from a little bit of language, which really wasnt necessary, in my opinion, this was SUCH an engaging story. I was completely fascinated with Norah and with the way her brain works. It was so interesting to see her inner dialogue and just how she perceived things and her fears and phobias. The relationship she had with her mom was beautiful as well.

When Luke, the new next door neighbor, helps her get the groceries in her house, she really isn''t quite sure what to do with him. Luke starts spending time with Norah at her house and they develop a very close relationship but Norah fears that she is keeping him from doing things. This book is told from Norah''s point of view. We get to see inside of Norah''s head and know exactly what she is thinking and it could be hard at times. Simple things could end up being really hard for her which is incredibly frustrating to her. She wants many of the things that other teens want but she doesn''t know how to overcome her crippling anxiety and fear in order to allow it to become a possibility. I thought that Norah''s inner dialogue were some of the most powerful moments in the book. I would recommend this books to others. It was an honest look at mental illness that really was eye opening at times. This book could be hard to read at times simply because of how realistic it felt. I thought that this was a strong debut novel for Louis Gornall and look forward to reading her future works. I received an advance reader edition of this book from Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Children''s Book Group via NetGalley.',1648339200000),

While this is going on, Cinder is working to dissolve the monarchy, and Iko struggled with her humanity, and Kinney questioned his own beliefs. Of the two, I think I liked this one better, because there was just more of everything More of the characters, more action, more loyalty, more adorable moments, more of everything that makes THE LUNAR CHRONICLES so loved.

And the illustrations are good, which is my only reason for rating this 2 stars instead of 1. Unfortunately, this story is poorly presented in a number of ways. First of all, the bond between characters feels shallow Their backstories are presented in confusing snippets that make their feelings for the main character look generic and artificial. Secondly, I believe the narrative should have begun much earlier in the overall story the scene that introduces the Iris character is a climactic event, so its pretty awkward to begin the main characters journey at that moment. Especially when the main character jumps right into the dialogue without any hesitation. Its as if she wasnt the least bit surprised by her surroundings. Thirdly, all the dialogue is stiff and forced. It makes the characters far less believable. Even worse, the oddly-arranged phrasing makes the grammar closer to Japanese than English, which is confusing to read. Whoever translated this did a mediocre job. I read some excerpts from the light novel at the back of this manga, and the writing is so minimal that it reads more like a script than a novel. Looks like the manga developers adapted a crummy light novel into a crummy manga.',1591401600000),

But then I decided to push through after hearing a review that it would get better after the initial chapters. And I am happy to say that it did get a lot better and it really developed into a deep and interesting story. It was fast to read, and the characters had a lot of depth despite my initial feeling that they were just completely crazy. The plot was surprising and it was fun to read from the so called villains POV and learning that everything is not always as it seems. Reading this novel also kind of made me want to turn my own novel into a graphic novel, and I might have given it a try had I been able to draw.

The plot was dangerous and exciting and kept the action flowing. There were other side stories that helped add more to the characters and show what progressiontrials being faced since the events of WINTER. I loved the way the book was designed and felt the drawings were representative of each character. Especially when they were feeling adorable to each other. Which is delightfully often.

The questions at the end are also very thought provoking and I could see why this book is used in High Schools as reading material for the students. It is eye-opening material about life on a Reservation. I loved Rowdy as a character, and as Junior''s bestie. One of the comments from the book made by Junior when talking about a baseball game says something like I got seven strikes in that game and I was hit once by the ball. Come to think about it, that was the only hit that we got all season. I know that I am not quoting it exactly, but I started laughing out loud and then called my husband to read it to him. I was thinking ''now that''s my idea of a bad day'', and poor Junior had many, many bad days in this unique and very talented written and illustrated young adult book. I could just imagine how young teens would laugh when reading it too.

It was very well-written, but the details sometimes were a little too much. I did like that the book brought up a lot of questions about right and wrong, as well as humanity, religion, and faith. Fans of sci-fi shouldn''t feel put off by the romance aspect of the book. It''s actually really slow burn between Abel and Noemi and isn''t the focus of the story.

Read at your own risk. OH MY GOD, MY HEART I feel as if my heart has literally beat itself into nothing. I don''t think that I have ever had such physical pain after ending a series. I literally wept through the entire epilogue and an over hour thereafter. I will have THE WORST book hangover this week. This month? Until the end of days? Who knows? Cassandra Clare, you sly dog, you will be the death of me. With all the upcoming Shadowhunter books coming out I may very well die of all the feels and my gravestone will read Here lies Vanessa, bludgeoned to death by the beat of her own heart while fangirling over Shadowhunters and Warlocks. A magnificent death to be sure. In all seriousness though, this book and this series really did destroy me. I have so much love for these characters. I feel like they are a part of me, like family. They are precious to me. That is how Clare writes her characters. She is innately talented in creating characters that fill you up with emotions. The reader really does live through them as they read. One of the best things about the characters that Clare writes is the relationships between the characters. The relationships are crafted so expertly, so seamlessly. Another wonderful thing about Clare''s character writing is the character growth. The main characters always have so much development as the story progresses. Personal growth as well as growth in their relationships with other characters in the story. Clare is just brilliant with writing characters. Another thing that makes this book and Clare''s Shadowhunter books so amazing is the scope of the plots in her books. The has a magical touch with creating compelling plots with story arcs spread throughout. The pacing of the plot is always spot on, always fluid. The reader is never bored and is always left wanting more. Clare has a superior way of including heart-wrenching twists in her stories and this book was no different. I may be repeating myself from my review of the last book in this series, but Clare''s world building is phenomenal All of her books build off of each other to create a truly unique world. Stories from the same world, but in different timelines. The time that it must have taken her to research and flesh out this world must have been years of her life. Clare is truly a master of creating intricate fantasy worlds that inspire and continue to grow. Overall, if you are looking for a book to thoroughly destroy you from the inside then look no further. This series will make you feel so many feels If you are an urban fantasy fan then this book and any of Clare''s books will feed your book lust. I highly recommend this book and this series I feel so strongly about this series that I feel I may have to start shoving a physical copy of it in people''s faces and rant about it like a madwoman. Now please excuse me while I inconvenience a necromancer and persuade him to nurse me back to life after being so thoroughly slaughtered by this series',1621209600000),

There are better materials to be had, of course, but this is what the brownies had on-hand. They were only too happy to rid themselves of it--they consider it quite useless, for all of the trouble that it brings. ''Ten Thousand Stitches'' is Book 2 of the Regency Faerie Tales series and my favorite historical fiction series hands down, written by one of my favorite indie authors.. Olivia Atwater. This lady single-handedly won my appreciation for the genre with ''Half a Soul,'' her debut of the series earlier this year and because of her, I''ve even learned to appreciate a couple of other historical fiction authors in recent months. Honestly, I''ve always disliked the verbiage of the eras as a rule, so reading an entire novel full of it was a chore to me. Olivia''s approach is different though.. and while there''s enough language of the time sprinkled throughout her stories to set the atmosphere, she never overdoes it. She''s found this balance.. where it''s present enough that I don''t find it too modern.. and I''m not distracted by it either. In this story, we follow Miss Euphemia ''Effie'' Reeves. A housemaid in the Ashbrooke manor who unfortunately falls in love with Benedict, a member of the family she serves. Though she knows the tales of caution regarding the Fair Folk, when she happens across a faerie named Lord Blackthorn who desperately wants to help her win Benedict''s heart, her unhappiness with her station makes her risk accepting his offer. Effie is given one hundred one days and ten thousand stitches.. to get Benedict to propose with Lord Blackthorn''s help or she is sworn to become even more of what she already is in her servitude, but the faerie lord''s overwhelmingly good intentions have a tendency to go wrong. If it makes you feel any better...Lady Hollowvale says that most faeries are very wicked indeed, by English standards. She tells me that I am a pleasant aberration. One of the most wonderful things about Olivia''s storytelling is the extensive knowledge through research or experience that she lovingly inks into every page. While truly fantastical, she infuses plenty of gritty texture too.. never shying away from the harsher realities of the time.. from the way people were treated to the challenges in their every day lives. She doesn''t feel the need to make the ugly truths seem pretty and palatable, but rather allows the reader to see each layer for what it really is. And though she likes to pull back the veil a bit, she also writes main characters with so much heart.. the way they see the good of others around them is rather beautiful. I love that she''s unafraid to address privilege in her worlds and the way it is often wielded without care for those who don''t have it. I also love the unapologetic way she paints her characters, not always needing to turn them into something new.. and instead, sometimes letting them learn to be happy with what they are. Her world-building is spectacular, as is always the way her faerie magic tends to work. The origin of faerie fabrics is utterly whimsical. Born of emotions and traits, the things crafted from them are prone to inspiring certain reactions in those around them. Another of my favorite elements she employs, is the way the faeries tend to belong to their realms.. rather than the other way around.. and the resulting sentience it lends them. But you can grow...You have already grown, in fact. You simply haven''t noticed it, because you are constantly looking at the sky, and not back down at your roots. Effie is adorable. She''s full of fire, even as she tries to keep it tucked away.. attempting to put her best foot forward and meet sometimes ridiculously unreasonable expectations. She cares about those around her strongly and cannot see herself to simply allow an injustice, even if it''s not in her best interest at times to speak up. Lord Blackthorn.. oh that lovely faerie made me emotional. Sometimes it was what he said.. and others it was what he didn''t. Atwater does a beautiful job with him.. allowing him to be vulnerable in unexpected ways.. and he''s just so earnest at times I found myself feeling very protective of him.. regardless of what disasters he might cause. If you like faerie tales and historical fiction.. I cannot recommend this series to you enough. ''Ten Thousand Stitches'' is out Tuesday, October 20th.. and book 3 is right around the corner too. In fact.. ''Longshadow'' is already available to pre-order Personally, though I read this in ARC form, I''ve already eagerly pre-ordered copies of both book 2 and book 3. I received this title as an ARC, but also pre-ordered it. All opinions are mine and freely given.',1618531200000),

The author does not stint on the gritty details, showing the difficulties servants had when their masters and betters live their lives with little understanding or appreciation of those who serve them. I loved the element of fairy in this storyespecially the magical fabrics that take on human traitsand the Cinderella aspect. The author weaves these seemingly disparate elements together with a deft hand. She certainly caught my interest right away, as I could sympathize with Effie having to clean up after those who take no care at all because they know their messes will disappear with no work from them.

In shortyes It''s packed with court intrigue, evil plots, deadly secrets...upon secrets...upon secrets, a bit of romance, tons of action, and it''s never clear who can be trusted. In other words, it''s one of the reads which keeps the reader in the pages until the very end. Malory is the first born in the kingdom of Devlishire and destined to be the Queen. Her knowledge and wisdom as well as her sword skills which does raise eyebrows are known throughout the seven kingdoms. When the High King of the seven kingdom alliance dies unexpectedly, her father''s interest in regaining the position for himself and his heirs becomes his main goal. Combined with her younger brother''s sudden interest in the throneher throne, she''s beginning to wonder if her position as future queen is threatened. What starts as a seed of doubt soon grows into something much larger than she ever suspected...or can guess. And so the web of secrets and lies begins. I enjoyed this one from the very first page. The world building is very well done and draws into the kingdom and the lives of the royals as if the castle truly existed. Small details make the scenes vivid but are woven in masterfully so as not to ever make the tale drag. It sets the stage for all of the excitement to come, and there''s plenty of that. Malory has everything a great queen needs and comes across as a very self-assured young woman...but she has her self-doubts, too. And it''s these doubts and the several mistakes she makes, which make her very easy to like and cheer for. She has a lot to go up against and makes mostly understandable choices and decisions along the way. Even if they aren''t always good ones. The plot in this one weaves back and forth and up and down and all over. Add in the multiple subplots, which give depth to the other characters, too, and it''s really an amazing layering. No one is to be trusted, but that doesn''t mean they''re selfish or evil. It''s hard to know where loyalties lie, why they lie where they do, and what the future might hold. Add the constant tension of an unknown danger, and it''s definitely a fast-paced, exciting read. While the tension makes this an engaging read, I also appreciate how Malory fit into the royal ladder. She''s a girl, and no matter what her heritage might be or who she is to wed, she still can''t break free of society''s order to things. She fights well but takes more than a back seat in that regard, since princesses and queens don''t wield swords. Her education has given her knowledge and her actions are often accepted by others as being wise, and yet, she''s held at a distance in the court...and she doesn''t even complain because she''s aware of her standing. In other words, I appreciate how the author kept a certain amount of reality to everything and didn''t make Malory an instant, kick-butt heroine. It makes her likable, slides into the reality of a traditional, royal court, and makes her all the more easy to cheer for until the end. But the story doesn''t end on the last page. Malory''s journey is only beginning, and it promises to be so much more.',1594080000000),

So imagine how excited I was when I learned an author had combined the two While it wasn''t what I expected, I was still very happy with it and fell in love with the characters. The pacing was a little slow, since the focus was mainly on the relationship between the Romanovs and their guards during the last days of their captivity. It lended well to the emotional weight of the story, but the real action occurred around the halfway point. Still, Anastasia, aka Nastya, was just so adorable all the time, had so much heart, forgiveness, and humour that the reader can''t help but love her. I also adored Alexei for his courage and determination. As for Zash... I find him to be a good character, very complex and tormented, but it took me a long time to accept his redemption arc. It was a challenge just due to the gravity of the Romanov massacre. The heart of the series is the relationships between the characters. It was a different way of telling a familiar story, and it painted other characters in different lights. I truly enjoyed the heart and historical accuracies, given how light it was on the actual magic. It surprised me, made me smile, and filled my heart with warmth.

New twists and turns for these three, and the other characters introduced in Clockwork Angel, make for a spell-binding adventure.  NEW OBSESSION ALERT I am officially obsessed with Will Herondale.  Also, I am officially obsessed with this The Infernal Devices series.  I loved Clockwork Angel and cannot wait to get my hands on Clockwork Princess.  Every time that I think there is finally a time to breathe and regain composure throughout the book, I am catapulted into another spinning plot twist.  The depth of not only the plot but each character and there are quite a few is immense.  I have not read a book in a long time that has forced me to react outwardly.  The world that Cassandra Clare creates is entirely consuming and it became difficult to separate myself from the book and reality.  I want to be part of Tessa, Jem, and most especially Will''s world.  It is gripping, encompassing, and unpredictable.  I root for these characters, I hope for these characters, and I grieve with these characters.  I have found this series to be riveting and invigorating Although I have only read 2 of the 3 books in this series, I highly recommend the series to those who love action, betrayal, romance, and fantasy.  I think it is appropriate for readers over the age of 16 and I recommend it for those seeking adventure. On the other hand, I would not recommend this book for those who do not appreciate betrayal, violence, manipulation, demons, magic, love triangles, unrequited love, or drug addiction.  Furthermore, I would not recommend this book for readers who have not read Clockwork Angel yet, as it would be very confusing. Lastly, I listened to this book on AudioCD.  It was read by Heather Lind and Ed Westwick. More than half was definitely read by Heather Lind, who was fantastic and gave a unique voice to each of the many characters.  Additionally, I also really enjoyed listening to Ed Westwick read the parts when it was in Will''s perspective.  His deep, sultry voice, made Will''s character even more alluring.',1602288000000),

OMG, this book OMG By the Angel, why did I wait so long to read this series? Then again, on the other hand, perhaps I am glad that I waited until all of the books were out because I do not think that I could have waited to find out what happens from book to book. First of all, this book gouged out my heart and put it back together over and over again. This book devastated my heart again and again. I''m not okay, all right? I thought that the characters from The Mortal Instruments series were my babies and that I could never love any Shadowhunters or Downworlders as much as I love them. I was wrong. While The Mortal Instruments characters will always be my babies, this mama has adopted The Infernal Devices characters and brought them into her heart. I have so much love for these characters and this brilliant world that Clare has envisioned. After I finish The Infernal Devices series I will be starting on The Dark Artifices series and I simply can''t wait This world will suck you in and refuse to let you go but, trust me, you won''t mind a bit. The world building in this series is fantastic Truly so, because it has so many elements. It is not only a Shadowhunter book, but one set in 1870''s London. I can''t even imagine all the research that went into perfecting the world held within the pages of this series. I love having a different perspective on the Shadowhunter world. It''s historical and in a different locale than Clare''s other Shadowhunter novels. I love how Clare''s Shadowhunter books build off of one another. Everything ties together in the end. There are different lines of Shadowhunter families spread across the ages and we get a glimpse of different generations of Shadowhunters. Information and events from The Mortal Instruments series tie in with those of The Infernal Devices series, and it is done so flawlessly. It''s so magical the way these histories flow together. My favorite part of this book and this series is the characters. They have so much depth and play off of each other so well. I immediately liked the characters from the start of the series, and those feelings only deepen in this book. These characters have become so special to me. Clare has a vivid way of implanting you right into the story so that you live it along with the characters. It''s quite a gift to have, and quite impressive. The plot gets so much better in the second book. We only scratch the surface of things in Clockwork Angel, but things really start to get interesting in this book. We get to see new characters and how they tie into the London Shadowhunter world. There are lies, deceits, and secrets galore in this It is truly riveting. The story keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole time. The romance in this is quite spectacular. So emotional. There is a love triangle that is written so expertly that there are hardly words to describe its splendor. The main character grows close to two different boys, and it is utterly convincing and warranted. Some love triangles are flat and unbelievable, but not this one. This is probably the best one that I''ve ever read. I know that Clare has done a mind-blowing job with the love triangle because I am seriously torn as to who I want Tessa to end up with in the end. I don''t want either boy hurt, nor Tessa. Ugh, if only polyamory were acceptable in 1870s London... Overall, this book was perfect If I had to impart one thing to you about this book it would just be GO READ THIS SERIES ALREADY I am serious, though. You need this series in your life. Once you have finished you will kick yourself for not reading it sooner, such as I did. I will immediately be picking up the last book and then try not to cry because it is the last book of the series. Why couldn''t this series have six books like The Mortal Instruments series, yeah?',1607731200000),

I love a good plot twist but it was nice to guess who the murderer was half way through and then slowly find evidence to back myself up. It was like 2 mysteries in one too because on one side we had the murder and on the other we had Inspector Han who Seol was conflicted about. They intertwined a little bit making for one big mystery If you like a good mystery, an interesting setting, and are not a fan of the violence that comes with a lot of crime books, then this is a great one for you',1648339200000),

This is a dark, grim read, yet it''s uplifting moments balance out the horrors of what the main characters have endured. Sybella is one of the strongest, most empowering female protagonists ever put to page. Her bravery and ferocity in the face of horrors and trials I cannot begin to imagine kept my riveted. The girl endured truly atrocious things at the hands of her family, and her progression through her arc had me hooked. Along with her is Beast, an ugly man with a heart of pure gold. The two of them together are a force to be reckoned with, and their romance completely swept me off my feet. The writing, action, plot twists, and secrets made for a stellar story. This book is expertly plotted and paced, and makes for a perfect read, despite the truly challenging subjects it tackles. I could not stop reading for anything, and was thinking about the book even after I''d put it down. This is a masterpiece of character development, romance, plot twists, and growth.

Evie is now helping her uncle catch a killer and if she and her friends dont stop him he will kill again. Evie ONeill is not a perfect heroine and has her faults and strengths. I really ended up loving her character as I wasnt her biggest fan for the first few chapters. This book is told from multiple characters PoVs mainly Memphis a Harlam runnerfor bookies, he collects bets and poet and Evie of course. I loved Memphis from his first chapter. I love his loyalty and love for his friends and brother. I love that he is a poet and writes his poems in a graveyard. Yes, I am a little weird and morbid. The author bought the 1920s to life. This wasnt just a few facts here and there and the speech wasnt modern like most authors do with historical and just put a few slang here and there. This was like living in 1920s New York but with the ghosts and other paranormal elements. I am very picky about mysteries and was so excited when I found a YA historical paranormal mystery on my local bookstores shelves. The characters are all full of life, secrets, and all have had something dark happen to them in the past. You even get the PoV of the killers and this book is not for the faint of heart. This book is very long and worth every page. I dont want to say much about the plot or a lot about the story as I want you to get to meet these characters and get to know them and their stories yourself and live and breathe in the 1920s and be lost in it like me.

Thank you In no way does this affect my rating or review. All included quotes have been taken from an ARC and may not match the finished publication. Content Warning Death of a loved one and animal, Suicide, Human  Animal sacrifice, Self harm cutting palm to perform magical rituals The entire Chicome Empire now relied on him. Hundreds of thousands of lives depended on his blood. He and his twin sister, Metzi, were now the only two surviving descendants of the sun god. To what lengths must a leader go to bring honor to their deities? It is a question that Prince Ahkin asks himself shortly after the passing of his father. Due to tradition, Ahkins mother takes her own life so that the emperor will not pass through the Underworld alone. But Ahkin is not ready to lead an entire nation. Without the guidance of his parents, Ahkin must grow accustomed to his new position. His first task to truly claim his title is to pick an empress to rule Chicome at his side. She was sick of the stifling and suffocating shackles of the rituals. She had fought against her heart for years to submit to them, constantly wrestling between what she wanted to do and what she should do. They had stolen the joy from her life. Now, they demanded her actual life. Mayana is the daughter of the leader to Alt--the water region of the kingdom. Due to being born into royalty, Mayana is from a line directly derived from the water goddess, and is able to bend water to her will. The magic calls for a price, and can only be summoned by blood. Sacrifices are a daily reality for the Chicome people. Due to the sacrifice Ometeotl made for them when sacrificing her children to reinstate a new sun, the people must pay the gods back in blood. For some, like Mayana, these traditions dont make sense. Why would a god, who supposedly loves the people, call for such a violent recompense? It is heresy to question the beliefs and practices of the gods, by Mayana cannot ignore her intuition that something isnt correct. Upon the death of the emperor, the prominent families in neighboring cities must send their most worthy daughters to compete for the hand of Prince Ahkin. Mayana is chosen, but at the apprehension of her father. Mayana hates making sacrifices--so much so that her family has to make excuses for her and why she wont do them. One of six contenders, Mayana must win against descendents of gods with fire, air, earth, healing, and animal powers. But if she doesnt win, she will see her end with the others that arent chosen, as the losers will be sacrificed to strengthen the waning sun. The true core of a person encompassed their whole being. Now that she saw Yemanias heart, the girl radiated beauty. Mayana hoped the prince would see Yemanias beauty as she did, but at the same time, she realized that if he did, it would seal her own fate. How was she supposed to hope for Yemania without dooming herself? The ceremony of choosing an empress naturally sets the girls against one another. For a compassionate soul like Mayana, the thought of sending someone to their death if she is chosen tears her apart. She makes fast friends with Yemania, a girl sent for her mediocre looks by a father who doesnt care about her fate. It highlights the intimately harsh reality that most women encounter throughout life, wondering if their beauty will measure up for others. As the competition unfolds, Mayana finds herself in the princes favor, but for reasons that arent her truth. Believed to be a pious follower of the gods and the codex of beliefs, Mayana knows that the prince is falling for someone that isnt the real her. Her mission becomes proving to not only herself, but to others that the codex they follow isnt entirely true. This, however, always puts her at risk to fall out of favor with the prince once he discovers her true beliefs. Mayana finds herself positioned between a competition to literally fight for her life, but another that requires her to remain true to herself. The Seventh Sun will keep any reader at the edge of their seat. This isnt entirely always for a good reason, as human sacrifice is a terrible reality in the Aztec and Mayan-inspired culture represented. I thought that this book gave a fantastic look into the lives of those that followed these traditions day-to-day. Sacrifice was a norm, but should never be taken lightly. Mayanas character was far too soft for this society, and it makes me wonder what the souls of others were like. Of course, this is a work of fantasy, so liberties may have been taken when compared to one hundred percent accurate historical fact of practices and traditions. A strong, sometimes disturbing, but deep read The Seventh Sun promises',1637625600000),

It wasnt that the narrator was bad, I thought she was quite good. But I think there was something about the narrative that just didnt work for my distracted mind. So I switched to reading my Kindle copy, and things went much better. I still found it hard to get sucked in to this one. There were moments that I absolutely loved But there were so many secrets, so much mystery, and from our heroine tooit just had me losing interest instead of drawing me deeper. I knew this was a series, so I wasnt surprised that there were still questions unanswered at the end of this one, but I might have needed a bit more Its like, part of me is interested in where this series is going, but theres another part that could totally see forgetting about it and never finishing it and not clamouring for more. I think another problem for me was that there wasnt a strong romance component. Which it doesnt have to have, by any meansbut I wonder if Id become invested in Guinevere with someone then Id have been more invested in general. I had suspicions and reservations about SO MANY characters, and it turns out with good reason for most of those characters, that in the end I just kept myself apart from it. The strongest component for me was wholeheartedly the friendships that Guinevere develops with so many strong and different female characters. And with that, the few twists and turns of diversity that I DIDNT see coming AT ALL I dont want to give anything away, but there were a few surprises that just absolutely delighted me. Which is why I will inevitably round up. Without all of this, I probably wouldnt have enjoyed this book that much. One other thing that delighted me was the way that magic was represented, specifically how Guinevere used her magic. I appreciated that there was a trade off  that using magic wasnt without consequences for her. That was fascinating. SO yeah. I have suspicions about a few things, but I almost wish Id gotten a few more hints before the end. I dont know what I think about how everything turned out.',1585958400000),

I thoroughly enjoyed this novel, so much so that I spent New Year''s Eve finishing it and was pleased with its ending. I was truly fascinated by Jane McKeene''s life as an Attendant and the combat school where she trained to learn how to dispatch zombies and protect high-class white women. The alt-history of the South and post Civil War is woven into the narrative effortlessly, but it doesn''t shy away from presenting it. I found myself wanting more than once while reading the novel to see Ms. Ireland''s notes on the world she''s created, but also the Native and Negro Education Act to get more backstory on the history of this law. I was so fascinated by its purpose. The world-building here is rich, and the alt-history, which includes the ugliness of slavery and racism, establishes this as a credible world where strong, adept black women are needed to fight back the overwhelming the zombie threat. Ms. Ireland gives us a somewhat satisfying, if open ending to her novel - and I say somewhat because I wanted more. I wanted to know what happens next with Jane McKeene, Red, Jack, and Katherine.

The only thing that slightly disappointed me, is that I wish the story finished less abruptly, but it is still a five stars books anyway. The books small chapters make it easy to read for any type of readers. I read it in only two sittings. For this reason, I recommend this book to everyone to read.

Water always finds a way back to itself. Late last year when ''The Guinevere Deception'' by Kiersten White was released, I was enamored first by the beautifully unique cover style and then immediately afterward by the concept of the story. I was excited to get a copy in a subscription box, but already at that point I had a long list of commitments to fulfill before getting to any casual reads and by the time I was able to fit one in.. unfortunately it had gotten shuffled around out of sight. So, needless to say.. with my penchant for jumping into series specifically on book two.. and I don''t know why this has become a thing with me.. but it absolutely has, I jumped at the opportunity to read an ARC of the follow-up. ''The Camelot Betrayal Camelot Rising Trilogy Book 2'' boasts an equally beautiful cover design and sounded, if possible.. even more exciting than the series debut. Generally speaking, I enjoy the idea of reinvention. Be that in reference to cover songs, remixes, film franchise reboots, or retellings.. I love to see what a creator might choose to do with inspired source material. Obviously, sometimes that has really disappointing results.. other times.. something truly special happens.. and entirely new life is breathed into that older work. This is one of those situations. Like many, I love the tales of Camelot. Merlin and Morgan.. Arthur and Guinevere.. the Knights of the Round Table.. these are the kinds of stories that continue to inspire throughout time. Though the legends of Tristan and Iseult Isolde are believed to have influenced the Arthurian tales, here.. in White''s tale.. they find a place alongside the legends of Camelot. It is more valuable to anticipate a blow than to avoid it. If I know which direction a blow is coming from, I can move with it instead of against it. In this book, King Arthur and Queen Guinevere have defeated their enemies once and are expending their efforts on ruling Camelot. Arthur, already comfortable in his role as King and Guinevere seemingly going through the motions while trying to find her place. Despite the evident closeness between herself and those around her, she continues to feel apart from everyone. With her dreams swallowed up by visions of darkness and power.. familiarity in unfamiliar places.. and a deep sense of foreboding, Guinevere is constantly looking over their proverbial shoulders in expectation of an attack. Each little discovery seems as if it should make her feel more secure, but something still feels wrong. Nothing appears to be quite when she was taught it was, but she questions her own judgment and it seems the threat could be coming from anywhere. Guinevere and Arthur are exceedingly kind, caring, likable characters. I find it interesting that a premise could be built on such polarizing lies and contain no feelings of negativity toward those carrying them out. Despite their secrets, they truly only want to do as much good for as many people as they possibly can.. and who can fault them for that? Sure, along the way.. some pretty bad things go down.. but it''s difficult to feel sorry for those on the receiving end, when all they do is ask for it. Do not imagine us whiling away our days in foolishness. Imagine us as the adder, curled and coiled in anticipation of the strike. I loved the gender flip of Lancelot and how it''s handled. It was impressive to see it both addressed in how the female night might be challenged by her role at the same time that she never seemed to be held down by it. She''s as strong and able, more so in most cases.. than any other knight. Unlike Brienne in Game of Thrones, there''s no great inner-conflict about who she is. There''s no struggle to be as tough as the men and still soft enough to carry a love story.. and I genuinely applaud the author for that. Other than the obvious small-minded comments of the occasional side character that imply the way she''s viewed is more stereotypical.. her gender is never actually an issue for her when it comes to carrying out her duties. She''s a knight first and does no worrying over finding a partner as if not having one in some way makes her anything less. She is movement and chaos, brightest life and sharpest death. There is no patience in her, no sense of the power of performing the same action over and over and over until eventually a different result is achieved. The story is rich visually, has an intriguing.. if not unfamiliar.. magic system, and has plenty of page-turning events to keep you from putting the book down. The author''s prose is elegant, without being overdone. Not unlike the dreams Guinevere is subjected to.. it flows like water itself-- I received this title as an ARC. All opinions are mine and freely given.',1607731200000),
